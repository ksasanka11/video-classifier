What is computer science?,-xFJM3QQ3TE,CS,"Frederick: COMPUTER SCIENCE IS THE ART OF TEACHING A COMPUTER WHAT TO DO. I'LL START WITH SOMETHING SIMILAR. LIKE, A SCREWDRIVER IS A TOOL THAT IS MADE TO KIND OF TURN SCREWS, AND ON ITS OWN, IT'S USELESS. YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT IN YOUR HAND AND KIND OF TURN IT TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN. Peters: A COMPUTER ACTUALLY LEARNS A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS AND ACTUALLY TRANSFORM THAT INTO A WAY OF SHOWING A MOVIE OR PLAYING AN AUDIO FILE OR DELIVERING FACEBOOK. AND THAT WHOLE STUDY OF HOW THE COMPUTER THINKS IS COMPUTER SCIENCE. Campos: IT'S CODE, AND SO CODE IS A BUNCH OF SYMBOLS AND LETTERS, BUT IT'S REALLY MORE LIKE A LANGUAGE. Bigio: I GOT HERE FROM PUERTO RICO, AND I DIDN'T KNOW ENGLISH, SO I HAD TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO PERFECT MY ENGLISH. PROGRAMMERS DO THE SAME THING. THEY LEARN NEW LANGUAGES TO DO NEW THINGS. THEY ARE INPUTTING THIS LANGUAGE AND THIS INSTRUCTION INTO THE COMPUTER SO THE COMPUTER CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT THEM TO DO. ♪♪ Frederick: GROWING UP, I WAS ONE OF THE VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO HAD ACCESS TO A COMPUTER AROUND ME. AND I REMEMBER BEING BORED ONE DAY AND I PICKED UP THIS BOOK THAT WAS NEAR THE COMPUTER THAT SAID ""BASIC PROGRAMMING,"" AND IT HAD THIS REALLY SIMPLE ""GETTING STARTED, HELLO, WORLD"" PROGRAM THAT YOU COULD WRITE IN BASIC, AND I REMEMBER WRITING IT AND RECOGNIZING THAT, ""WAIT, HOLD ON. I JUST PUT THIS THING IN AND TOLD THIS COMPUTER HOW TO DO THAT, AND IT CAME BACK OUT."" AND I HAD MY BROTHER COME IN AND USE IT, AND HE'S LIKE, ""OH, MAN, YOU MADE THE COMPUTER SAY HELLO?"" I WAS LIKE, ""YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, I DID. ISN'T THAT COOL?"" ♪♪ Ghadiyali: IN OUR EVERYDAY LIVES, YOU SPEAK LANGUAGE AND YOU USE THAT TO COMMUNICATE AND INSTRUCT WHEN YOU'RE AROUND PEOPLE. SIMILARLY, A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS EXACTLY THE SAME THING. IT'S JUST A LANGUAGE THAT YOU'D USE TO TALK TO THE COMPUTER. Frederick: AND THINK ABOUT THE FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING. LET'S SAY IT'S AN ALARM CLOCK. THERE ARE INSTRUCTIONS THAT SOMEBODY PUT INTO THAT ALARM CLOCK TO TEACH IT HOW TO TELL TIME, HOW TO RESPOND TO YOU HITTING THE SNOOZE BUTTON. YOU'RE WALKING OUT OF THE HOUSE AND YOU JUMP IN YOUR CAR AND YOU START IT. THERE ARE LOTS OF COMPUTERS IN THERE FIGURING OUT HOW TO TURN THE ENGINE THE VERY FIRST TIME, HOW MUCH GAS TO PUT IN. THE SET OF INSTRUCTIONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE PUT INTO ALL THESE LITTLE DEVICES YOU'VE USED THROUGHOUT YOUR DAY JUST MADE YOUR DAY THAT MUCH EASIER TO GET THROUGH. Bigio: YOU WANT DIRECTIONS OR YOU'RE DIALING A PHONE NUMBER, YOU'RE ACTUALLY INTERACTING WITH A COMPUTER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AT HAND. THAT'S COMPUTER SCIENCE AND PROGRAMMING RIGHT THERE, EVERY DAY IN YOUR HAND. Ghadiyali: PROGRAMMING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO HAVE IMPACT IN THE WORLD. THERE IS NO OTHER CAREER, NO OTHER FIELD WHERE YOU CAN TOUCH SO MANY PEOPLE'S LIVES WITH JUST A SIMPLE SOFTWARE OR A SIMPLE APP. AND IT'S SPECIFICALLY ALSO IMPORTANT FOR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES TO BE INVOLVED BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT COMPUTERS ARE EVERYWHERE, PROGRAMMING IS EVERYWHERE, AND WE WANT AN EQUAL REPRESENTATION WHEN WE ARE BUILDING PROGRAMS. Frederick: WE NEED PEOPLE WHO HAVE A BROAD RANGE OF PERSPECTIVES TO FIND DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS. Bigio: CREATING PRODUCTS FOR THE PEOPLE, YOU NEED TO BE THE PEOPLE. AND IF WE HOPE TO HAVE PRODUCTS OUT THERE THAT REALLY SERVE OUR NEEDS, WE NEED TO BE INVOLVED -- PROGRAMMING, LEARNING COMPUTER SCIENCE, AND BEING PART OF THE CREATION PROCESS OF THIS NEW WAVE OF INNOVATION."
What is Computer Science Principles?,jQm0z894CG0,CS,"It's pretty amazing when you start building something that you want it can help change a lot of people's lives as well. And having even a little bit of grounding in computer science can help you think about the world differently. Whether that's algorithms or whether thats just creativity. Computer Science Principles covers lots of topics. Not just programming and coding... we cover bits and binary, we cover how the Internet works, how security works, how data is collected and used and shared. And all of these things help you get a better understanding of how the world works. Now I understand why my phone is so slow. I thought computer science was just, like for y'know, really really smart nerds, geeks, but... it's not. It's for everybody and I think it's something that everybody should learn. In the new economy computer science isn't an optional skill, it's a basic skill. I just think it's important, moving forward in the future that everybody learn it - especially kids. I didn't know what I was getting myself in to but like once I had my friends around I knew that if they could do it I can do it. So it's really like brought my confidence up in other classes as well. If you use SnapChat and Instagram and you want to know how that works take Computer Science Principles. Make an app yourself. See how you can share these things with your friends. To be able to code gives you the freedom to build anything. And that is just so empowering! We're doing a lot of teamwork, like group work. Like doing work on paper not just always on the computer. And then when I say ""go"", we're gonna exchange IP addresses without talking. And I want everybody's IP address. Some of the kids that maybe don't fit into a normal classroom they have an opportunity to kind of try different things and different techniques and different mindsets. It feels more like a puzzle. And you get to take your own route and find the solution. I feel like this class is one of the only classes that challenges me. But I feel like ""Y'know what - I got this!"" Like, this is good. Computer science isn't just about math or computers. If you're interested in designing things, creating things, solving problems... then this class is for you. Subtitles by the Amara.org community"
Computer Science Basics: Hardware and Software,vG_qmtdBPTU,CS,"Hardware and software to terms. You've probably heard of at one point or another The odds are high that you use both on a daily basis, whether it's with your smartphone or personal computer Let's take a deeper. Look at what these two things are and why they're important hardware is any element of a computer that's physical this includes things like monitors keyboards and also the insides of devices like microchips and hard drives Software is anything that tells hardware what to do and how to do it including computer programs and apps on your phone. So video games Photo editors and web browsers are just a few examples Hardware and software are very different from each other, but they also need one another in order to function Let's look at an example of this using a smart phone in this case The hardware would be the physical phone itself and the software would be its operating system and its apps If we were to take away the software we would just have a dead phone in our hands it wouldn't be able to make calls Text or go online because it's not receiving any kind of instructions on the other hand Let's say we have no hardware. Meaning there's no actual phone if all we have are the programs We just have a bunch of instructions, but nothing to give those instructions to So the big picture here is that hardware needs software to tell it what to do But software also needs Hardware in order to act out its directions Technology will continue to evolve and though we may not be sure of how things will look in say a hundred years this Combination of hardware and software will be there serving as its foundation GCF global creating opportunities for a better life"
Steve Jobs on Computer Science,IY7EsTnUSxY,CS,"I think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer. Should learn a computer language, because it teaches you how to think. And so I view computer science as a liberal art. It should be something that everybody learns, you know takes takes a year in their life, one the courses they take is you know, learning how to program."
Computer Science Basics: Algorithms,kM9ASKAni_s,CS,"You may have heard the term Algorithm recently, whether it was online or maybe in some conversation about technology. It's a word that gets thrown around a lot. But what exactly does it mean? Well, simply put an algorithm is a set of steps used to complete a specific task. They're the building blocks for programming and they allow things like computers, smartphones, and websites to function and make decisions. But in addition to being used by technology, a lot of things we do on a daily basis are also similar to algorithms Let's say you want to make some spaghetti. In order to do this successfully,  there's a certain set of steps you need to follow in a particular order. First you need to boil a pot of water. Once it's boiling you then add the spaghetti and cook it for a set amount of time, stirring occasionally. Once it's finished you drain the water and then it's ready to be served with a sauce of your choice. That entire process is actually an algorithm. Because you followed those steps in that order, you reached your desired outcome, a delicious pasta dish. But, if you were to make a mistake, say over or under cooking your noodles, it probably wouldn't be as good. Programs work in a similar way. Their code is made up of algorithms telling them what to do. Let's say that we want to use a navigation app to get directions. When we punch in a destination, the app uses an algorithm to look at the various available routes. Next, it uses a different algorithm to check the current traffic. And then a third one takes that information and calculates the best available route. All of these algorithms are built right into the apps code. If there were any kind of error in that code, the app wouldn't be able to follow these algorithms correctly. Meaning, you wouldn't receive your directions. Both of these examples show how both humans and computers can use algorithms to perform everyday tasks. The difference is that computers can use algorithms and calculate things better, faster, and more efficiently than we can. Technology is only going to continue to evolve and get even better at what it does. As long as coding and programming continue to be used, algorithms will be at the heart of these technologies guiding what they do and how they do it.

President Obama asks America to learn computer science,6XvmhE1J9PY,CS,"Hi everybody. This week I'm proud to join the students, teachers, businesses and non-profit organizations taking big new steps to support computer science in America's schools. Learning these skills isn't just important for your future, it's important for our country's future. If we want America to stay on the cutting edge, we need young Americans, like you, to master the tools and technology that will change the way we do just about everything. That's why I'm asking you to get involved. Don't just buy a new video game, make one. Don't just download the latest app, help design it. Don't just play on your phone, program it. No one's born a computer scientist, but with a little hard work, and some math and science, just about anyone can become one. This week is your chance to give it a shot. And don't let anyone tell you ""you can't."" Whether you're a young man or a young woman, whether you live in a city or a rural area, computers are going to be a big part of your future. And if you're willing to work and study hard, that future is yours to shape. Thanks everybody!"
Why I chose my major: Computer Science &amp; Engineering,UKA3HMz2Qf0,CS,"I chose computer science because, at first, I just really liked coding and I thought, 'Wow, this is a lot of fun.' But then I also saw how many different applications there are. You know you go in thinking, 'I'm just going to sit at a desk and code. But then you realize there's so many different applications of this field that can really help people, whether that's artificial intelligence or biomedical devices. There's just so many diverse ways to be creative. So what I love about computer science is that it really starts out at the general level and so you get an idea of all the different components that go into computer science. And then once you get into the upper division, you get to choose a track and find what really speaks to you and makes you excited to do work. And, so for me, that's been the security track—where I'm really excited about all the classes. I get to learn about how the computer systems work and how they're built to make them more secure. And I'm really excited to keep learning more about that as I go on. I know a lot of my friends are doing research, and I've done two internships now. It was two years at the same company and then this summer, I'll be doing another one. And it's really great because here there's so many software companies just everywhere—that you can really get your footing even as a sophomore and get that opportunity to learn outside of the classroom. At first I was a little intimidated by the professors. I was like, 'Oh you're doing all this stuff, you don't really have time to talk to students.' But then you go to their office hours and you realize, 'Oh you really do care about the material you're teaching and the students you're teaching it to.' And I think a lot of them really show that by taking the time to have conversations about the topics that they're teaching— not just what's on the homework. But also how is this going to play out in the real world and how will I face this in my career. And I really appreciate the time they take to do that."
Careers with Computer Science: Aerospace Engineer at NASA,2uXTNK9W-gQ,CS,foreign Davis and I'm an aerospace engineer at NASA what's NASA and liftoff NASA is a space agency that is looking to help the world better understand what's going on around us and other planets [Music] what do you do at NASA I use computers every day I program spacecrafts to look at specific points on a planet to get back science data [Music] what do the spacecrafts do various missions that we have they have different objectives whether it's increasing the knowledge on the weather to things like increasing knowledge about asteroids when did you learn about computer science I knew about computers growing up we had you know computer class but I wasn't that into computers and maybe it was because I thought that wasn't like the cool thing to do but it wasn't until later that I started to understand what possibilities come with computers and then I started saying this is actually kind of fun after I took a class in programming now it's something that I do almost on a daily basis something that I thought I couldn't do I'm doing every day and it's a lot of fun what is the coolest thing about your job the single coolest thing to me about working at Nasa is the fact that I can look into the sky at night and think about all the spacecrafts that I've worked on that are currently orbiting the Earth or orbiting an asteroid is really rewarding and so that's really cool to me [Music]
The Beauty of Computer Science | Computer Science Motivational Video,mCJWiR3Vdi8,CS,"This is such a strange thing. Your software Linux is in millions of computers  it probably powers much of the Internet.  And I think that there are like a billion  and a half active android devices out there   your software is in every single one of them. It's kind of amazing. You you must have some amazing  software headquarters driving all this. That's what I thought and I was  shocked when I saw a picture of it. I mean this is this is the Linux World Headquarters. Well I do code for fun. But I want to code for something meaningful. So, every single project I've ever  done has been something I needed and uh So, really both both Linux and Git kind of arose almost as an unintended consequence of your desire not to have  to work with too many people.  Absolutely! Yes now yeah That's that's amazing. I think everybody in this country  should learn how to program a computer.   Should learn a computer language because it teaches you how to think. It's the idea that matters. It didn't matter where you come  from or what your background is One revolutionary idea One brilliant invention can unleash other entrepreneurs to revolutionize industries in  ways you could never predict. People working anywhere in the world. Born anywhere in the world. Can create a product and make it available to anyone in the world. The most used messaging app in Southeast Asia   was built by a young man born  in Ukraine who moved to the U.S. And the three most popular viral  games in the U.S in recent years came from entrepreneurs in Finland Ireland and Vietnam You're the ones building the next Google The next Spotify The next Tesla The next... Well we don't even know. But what I know is that someone  in this room will build it. Computer science is by far  the closest thing to magic. And it's certain that the world wouldn't be where it is right now without the existence  of this magnificent branch of science. And this branch of science is growing so fast that it's difficult for even good  programmers to keep up with it. Every day a new technology is releasing. Every day new opportunities are rising. "
Computer Science Basics: Should I Learn to Code?,reU05DbfWOM,CS,"In recent years, there's been a lot of hype around coding: that it's an invaluable skill everyone should learn, or that it's a field where there's a lot of money to be made. And, while there are a lot of great reasons to learn to code, it might not be the best career choice for everyone. In order to determine if coding is a good fit for you, you'll want to consider a number of different aspects. One thing to think about is the job market: there are a lot of jobs and freelance opportunities out there for programmers, and many of them pay well, but there are also even more programmers seeking jobs. Studies showed that there are 50% more people seeking employment than there are actual coding positions. This means that simply knowing how to code isn't a surefire way to land a job: employers are looking for the highest quality programmers out there. Like any skill, coding takes dedication and patience to develop: the more time you put into it, the better you'll become. Learning your first coding language might prove to be a long and difficult process, but the good news is that once you've learned one, others become easier to grasp. As technology continues to evolve some new jobs are going to be created, but some of today's jobs will also become obsolete. Some argue that it might be a better investment to study growing fields, like AI and machine learning; but, on the other hand, learning to code is a great way to gain an understanding of software from the bottom up, and it can serve as a jumping off point if you want to move into those fields in the future. So, should you learn to code? There are a lot of opinions out there, but ultimately it's up to you. If it seems like something you really enjoy and you're willing to put in the effort, go for it, but if it's something you're on the fence about, you might want to keep looking. There are a lot of other options out there, and you're bound to find something that's a better fit for you."
Computer Science at Cambridge,94NgNNs1O3Q,CS,[Music] one of the things that is really unique and special about computer science degree in Cambridge is that you're gonna be taught by cutting at world leaders in their own fields who are really excited about their work the course of Cambridge involves pretty much anything that you can think of to do with computers and technology from really foundationally theoretical material on automation of mathematics at one extreme - intense funding projects at the other I've always been fascinated by the way that computers can solve problems both for myself and for other people and that's that's really really interested in me so it seemed like a natural thing to study when I went to university I've always enjoyed doing logic puzzles small challenges and also I wanted to learn everything that I could about computers which I think computer science embodies perfectly but also I want it to be in a really good challenging environment which Cambridge offers and have all these brilliant minds around me computer science at Cambridge seemed just the right course [Music] our course is structured so that we teach our students the theoretical background that underpins the principles of computer science but also with their hands-on experience of putting that theoretical knowledge into practice my favorites perience on the course so far has been the group project in my second year in which I worked with a group of people to produce a piece of software for a company I got to present the project to all the other students and the people from other companies and it was really exciting [Music] the employability prospects for our graduates are really first-rate we're also a very intrapreneurial place so lots of our graduates go on to found their own companies and startups one thing that we find out when we start studying computer science is that this is a subject that opens up so many different doors we can we can work in many different fields doing many different things what I would like to do is go and work for a software company and maybe with that learn some skills in my own so I can I can start my own in the future and solve problems my own way by applying for masters and then going on to do research either here at your lab or an industrial research I feel I will be able to bring a contribution to the field of computer science [Music] fundamentally computer science ends up being about solving really hard problems in the best possible way so if there's one key thing that you couldn't come away from the Cambridge degree in computer science with it's being a really really good problem solver we are genuinely interested in people who are self motivated and passionate about technology if you're curious then come to us and we will teach you the theoretical and the practical ways of how you can build systems that are going to make our world a better place Oh
Computer Science Matters,_IiPLtP-jm8,CS,"So what grade are you in? Second. Tenth grade. First grade. I was in eighth grade when I learned to program. I got my first computer when I was in sixth grade. What gets me excited is being able to fix people's problems. You can express yourself. You can build things from an idea. Computer science is the basis for a lot of the things that college students and professionals will do for the next 20 or 30 years. I like programming because I like helping people. I get the opportunity to build something that makes people's lives easier. I think it's the closest thing we have to a super power. Getting started is the most important part. I'm a beginner myself, and I want you to learn with me. "

How MIT computer scientists got to MIT,huYmEFkd5Y8,CS,"[MUSIC PLAYING] How did you get to MIT? I sort of had a long path to getting here. But I was a math undergrad, and then I actually was an economics PhD for a couple of years before deciding that robotics was my true calling. And then through a fortunate series of events, I ended up working on the dark robotics challenge and then ended up in Russ's lab. I came to MIT after my PhD at Boston University. I did my PhD in robotics. And before I did robotics, I actually studied pigeons and how they fly and their dynamics of flights. And so pigeons is the way I got into robotics, by looking at the dynamics of them and then wondering what could happen if you could also control those systems. I finished my undergrad and my masters back in 2011. And then I was working in industry for two years at Johns Hopkins applied physics lab, which was fun, but it was more development. And I really wanted to do research. I really wanted to go back for my PhD. So I worked on a few research projects and I applied for my PhD a few places. Got accepted to a few. Got rejected from a lot. And I wound up joining everybody here at MIT for my PhD. So I did my undergrad here, and I really liked the community. And especially I did a UROP, the undergraduate research with Daniella. So I enjoyed that and I was happy to stay on as a grad student. I won a scholarship for my research being one of the grand challenges in engineering and a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge. And this year, I'm a Charles M. Vest scholar at MIT. I had mentioned to an undergrad professor that I was thinking about maybe applying to PhD programs. And she said, you know, you should do it. You should definitely do it. You know, who cares if you get it or not? You should definitely try. And I think that little push that someone believing in me was what I needed to get over my fear and apply to MIT and that is how I got in. I came here as an undergrad and I came to the admittance day weekend. And it was a lot different than all of the other colleges I had been to and everyone I met was really interesting. So I sort of just decided to come. And then once I was here, it became really hard to leave. So I'm still here. [MUSIC PLAYING]"
MIT Computer Scientists talk about their first computer science textbook,7PbuWwWXftg,CS,"[MUSIC PLAYING] What was your first computer science textbook? I feel like it was called, like, Java by Construction, was my first textbook. It was like an introduction to programming in Java, which I took in a freshman coding class at Princeton. My mom gave me a textbook when I was about eight years old, an introduction to Python. And she started reading it to me when I was in class, and that was a huge moment for me. I got a textbook on MATLAB programming, I think. And I don't know if I ever cracked the spine of it once. CLRS textbook, the algorithms textbook that they use in the algorithms class here at MIT-- it's definitely like a mammoth of a textbook, but I feel like it's sort of a rite of passage. I wasn't a huge fan of textbooks. I mostly read the course notes that were posted in a lot of classes. But there's an introduction to algorithms textbook I used. I think it's by one of the Kleinbergs, and Eva Tardos as well. And that was a great textbook. I love that textbook. And it's really fun, because each problem is sort of structured as like a little puzzle that you have to solve. So that was my first textbook that I enjoyed. You know, I don't think I've ever used a computer science textbook. When I really think through all of my computer science classes, maybe they assigned a textbook, but I didn't get it. Most of the time the problem sets were available online. The lectures were all available online. And most of what you learn is from Googling all the different questions you might have, and other people telling you from-- maybe, I guess, textbook-wise, Wikipedia. Wikipedia is my favorite computer science textbook. [MUSIC PLAYING]"
Create With Computer Science,lud4bU3YY9U,CS,well I think creativity plays a role in almost everything that we do from cooking to making music which is what I do but in computer science you have to have a creative mind [Music] computer science it is Art and everybody has a different style and I think that that's a beautiful thing about computer science is that it's flexible as you iterate through code and you start seeing what experiences you're lighting up it is just like a piece of art when you read someone else's code it's almost like reading poetry you try to follow how their mind went about solving a problem no art exists without technology a paintbrush is a piece of technology a typewriter is a type of technology so as we keep coming up with new types of Technology artists are always going to come in and find some new ways to use it in ways that are unexpected there is no creativity without technology and Technology does not exist without creativity [Music] [Applause]

Crash Course Computer Science Preview,tpIctyqH29Q,CS,"Hello world! I’m Carrie Anne Philbin and welcome to Crash Course Computer Science! So, computers really have allowed us to do some pretty amazing things - think global telecommunications, international commerce, global transportation, breakthroughs in medicine, distributed education, online shopping, online dating, just the Internet in general. Computers are allowing us to explore our own world and other worlds, and of course some seemingly mundane things like permitting us to spy on our pets from work or communicate with our friends in a nearly indecipherable stream of emoji! But don’t call computers magical. They are not, I repeat ARE NOT, magical. So before we get into what we are going to talk about in this course, it might be useful to tell you what we aren’t going to talk about. We aren’t going to teach you how to program. Programming is a really crucial aspect of computer software, and we will get to the rules that guide the logic of hardware and software design. But we aren’t going to teach you how to program an Arduino Uno to water your plant or how to change the CSS on your grandma’s sewing blog so visitors’ cursors turn into kittens. This also isn’t a computing course. Or at least how computing is thought of in the U.S. Computing here is a goal - it’s what computers do. And we’ll talk about some of that for sure, but OUR goal for this course is much broader. But computing means other things in other countries. It’s all pretty confusing. But what we are going to look are the history of computers… even before we had electricity. We’re going retrace the design decisions that have given us our president-day components. We’re going to talk about how Operating Systems work… or don’t work… how the YouTubes get to you over the Internet, how our smartphones and other smart devices are... well getting smarter, and of course mysterious futuristic stuff like quantum computing and frustrating present-day stuff like hacking! It’s a lot to cover, but I suppose before we get started I should introduce myself. I’m Carrie Anne Philbin! Hello! I'm an award winning secondary Computing teacher, author of 'Adventures in Raspberry Pi' and the creator of a YouTube video series for teenagers called the Geek Gurl Diaries, which includes stuff like interviews with women working in technology, computer science based tutorials, and hands on digital maker style projects. In my day job, I help people learn about technology and how to make things with computers as Director of Education for the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which is a charity based in Cambridge in the UK. Needless to say, I am passionate about this stuff, but not because computers are these amazing devices that are always making our lives easier (sometimes that’s debatable) but because computers inarguably have become pivotal in our society. From our cars and thermostats to pacemakers and cellphones, computers are everywhere, and it’s my hope that by the end of this course you’ll have a better understanding and appreciation for how far we’ve come and how far they may take us. I’ll see you next week."

A new Gallup poll of kids is revealing what they say could make them 10 times more likely to go into the computer science field as Alex Davis explains. It's about making a people connection. Computers and Robotics are a mainstay in our everyday lives yet a Gallup poll in partnership with Amazon found that while kids interest in computer Sciences, widespread participation is not nationally. We see that 70% of students report that there's at least one course within their school system today where they can take computer science and learn more about the topic. Unfortunately, that number drops dramatically for who live in rural areas throughout the U.S. and soon to come from lower-income households are far less likely than their peers report. There is, of course, currently available within their school more about computer science. The Amazon future engineer program.

Is a Computer Science Degree Worth It?,ShNrn6KPWUk,CS,"I chose the computer science degree program at SNHU because I am a self-taught engineer. I started learning code at 35. It was a struggle from the get go and I watched some of my colleagues level up their skills faster and move on to bigger and better positions while I frankly got bogged down trying to learn some of the basics. And I knew that the best way to shore up the deficiencies was to get an actual education. My name is Jeff DeWitt and I'm a graduate of Southern New Hampshire University. I've known a couple of people who have actually attended SNHU and SNHU has a big reputation. So not only was there a computer science degree program that I could pursue completely, 100% online whenever I wanted to go, but they offered different specialties, too, so I could I could hone in on different things if I wanted to. The way the degree program is kind of set up in the way that I guess the institution itself supports students, I felt that I always had somebody in my corner. It was the way in which my advisors were constantly reaching out to me, checking to see if I needed anything. The instructors themselves were always available and the interactions that I had with my fellow classmates was phenomenal. I still keep in touch with a couple close friends that I made at school when I finally completed my degree program. I definitely missed it at first, and it seems surreal. Not only did I get the degree that I wanted to get, but I got the GPA that I worked so hard to get. And then you go to the actual ceremony and you are in the auditorium with all of the other students who are graduating. And it's one of those feelings that, you know, is a pretty rare experience and that you're going to remember for the rest of your life. I got hired the same month as I graduated. I landed a fully remote, full stack developer position working for the federal government at every step of the way. I felt like people were there to offer support and to reinforce that they are willing to work with me to help me accomplish my goals. SNHU empowers you to build the future that you want. You just need to get started."
Computer Science Careers at Montgomery College,wDn_UvwPhnI,CS,"♪ Music ♪ Montgomery College is giving me the opportunity to achieve my goal. I'm doing things I never thought I could see myself doing when I was a senior in high school. The Montgomery College Computer Science program offers computer science and technologies associate degrees and also and also two certificates: computer programming certificate and Java developer certificate. Most of the classes I teach are eighteen to twenty, twenty two students, something like that, so you get a lot more attention. I think the fact that we have smaller classes at Montgomery College is helpful, primarily for the fact that professors, they can pay more attention to you, because there's less people. Amazing, amazing, amazing professors! I so miss them. Students come out of this program very well prepared. Montgomery College prepared me for my classes at College Park. Even on my first day I felt like I was prepared for what was about to come. The job market is very good for computer science and technology students. They are in demand.

Favorite programming languages of MIT Computer Scientists,39b_GSDPwCY,CS,"[MUSIC PLAYING] What's your favorite programming language, and why? I definitely like Python. I actually learned to code on C and C++. And it's a lot harder when there are more brackets and more complicated things. And I feel like Python abstracts away a lot of that while still giving you a lot of functionality, and allows you to do a lot of really cool machine learning things. My favorite programming language is Python because of ease of use and speed of development. And I especially love using [INAUDIBLE].. I like Python because originally, I learned how to program in C. And Python is just a lot more high level, and it's a lot easier to use. I hate them all equally. No, that's not true. I like most programming languages. Lately I've been programming in Python. It's a fairly convenient language. My favorite programming language is probably C#. I like it because it fixed everything that Java did wrong. But mostly it's become a standard in the gaming industry. And I really love video games. I love being able to program video games. And it's a really nice, easy-to-use language. Honestly, I guess I would probably say Python, which is maybe a boring answer, because I guess a lot of people would say that. But for me, it's just really easy to prototype and build things quickly, which is important in my research. I love Python. I think Python is like writing English at times. It's almost so easy to understand for programmers, [? even ?] when you want to do the low-level things, which is incredibly powerful. I prefer Python because it's easy and you can program very easily tasks, and you can see the results quite quickly. At the risk of not being a programmer, I do a lot of programming in MATLAB because that's what I know. And it's very good for controls. But for a real language, I like Python. I can say my least favorite, also if people want that, is C and C++, because you make a ton of bugs and they're impossible to solve. Waste your whole day. [MUSIC PLAYING]"

Career Paths in Computer Science,Zr06O9NlEZE,CS,"- Are you just starting out in your journey to become a programmer or maybe thinking about starting out? If so, then this video is gonna be right up your alley. Stay tuned. (upbeat electronic music) Hi, my name is Tim Buchalka and thanks for checking out this video. So, another common question I get in my courses from students goes along, or goes something like this, Tim, I'm taking your Java Masterclass course, or my C# course or Python course, et cetera, and I wanna get into these technologies, and there's a list of various technologies, which way should I go? Which course should I study? Which courses after this one should I study? And do you recommend this particular career path or that career path? My answer to that is, oh, slow down. Take a step backwards and really try and focus on completing your first course. So again, if you've taken a Java course or a Python course, et cetera, number one priority is to finish that course first. You can start mapping out where you're gonna go in the future after that. And in actual, as you go through and gain more experience as a programmer, you'll find that your choices may change. So if you sat down when you first started out on your journey, your very first programming course, and try to map out the way you want it to be, you'll probably find towards the end of that first course, once you got the basic understanding of a programming language under your belt that you'll change your mind. You might decide, for example, to get into mobile app development or you might decide to get into web app development, desktop applications, whatever it is. So, the point is don't try and think so far into the future when you're just learning to become a programmer. Focus on learning the basics first and at the end of that first course or that first chunk of training, when you've got some experience with the language under your belt, then start thinking about it. All righty, so I hope that helped. If you've got any questions, feel free to leave a comment and I'll get back to you.

Why study Computer Science?,-gnW2p9FF9c,CS,I decided to study Computer Science because I had the background I particularly always liked robots My interest started probably as most young boys' interests start in computer science is when they get their first computer for me i've always had an interest in computers from a young age and it's one of those things that I wasn't too sure what I wanted to go into and computer science obviously offers a wide diverse range of opportunities you can look into I was about 16 making A Level choices I decided I really wanted to make video games which for instance now I don't want to do but it did spark my interest in the subject once I actually came to university I realised there's a lot more to computer science than just games development I did lots of different types of work experience to work out what I really wanted to do I was always good at mathematics and computer science at school I was into gaming as a kid I think the thing with computer science is that it entrenches so many different fields that we all go in our life It really opened my eyes to see what computing could be used for in the real world and make people's jobs a lot more efficient I can go into so many things with computer science it was trying to choose between maths and computing and got really into programming The sixth form I went to had an A Level in computing and from there you know my favourite subject I started reading science fiction books and movies and the AI part of it all very interested me my inspiration actually came from one of my classmates he used microcontrollers to make a little simple toy car move by the means of a joystick or a telephone and I was like wow if you can do this how many others things can you do I wouldn't say I'm a stereotypical computer scientist I don't think that stereotypical computer scientist is actually a thing
Summer of Research: Where Music Meets Computer Science,SWzK8VWVt3s,CS,"[Graham Palmer] I looked at the 14th harmonic maybe the difference is really small but its, its completely random. [Jake Altabef] My name is Jake Altabef. I go to RPI. I am a rising junior and I study computer systems engineering. This summer I'm doing research analyzing music, specifically jazz. So far, we looked at signal-to-noise ratio over mediums from vinyl to cassette to CD. We've also done frequency analysis. I've never had a formal music education, no music theory or anything like that. What I have in college is essentially coding and algorithms. Seeing this connection between audio engineering and music with computer science is really good because it gives me somewhere to put an end goal in my career. As I'm wrapping up college, I know that I need experience either doing research moving forward into a PhD or moving into industry. Going back to audio engineering, I would like to do a master's in that. That'd be really cool something that I haven't done before, something that I should have pursued. During the semesters, once it gets to mid and late semester, I will be doing like 40 hours of coding for one class and just having the freedom to not do anything during the summer other than research is incredible."

What is cryptography? | Journey into cryptography | Computer Science | Khan Academy,Kf9KjCKmDcU,CS,"Imagine two people who share an important secret have to split up. This requires them to communicate private information from a distance. However, an eavesdropper named Eve also wants this information, and has the ability to intercept their messages. So, Alice decides to communicate using letters written in some kind of secret code. The following analogy is helpful. First, Alice locks her message in a box, using a lock that only she and Bob know the combination to. This is known as 'encryption.' Then, the locked message is sent to Bob. When Bob receives the box, he opens it using the code they shared in advance. This is called 'decryption.' Cryptography begins when we abandon physical locks and use 'ciphers' instead. Think of [ciphers] as virtual locks. Ciphers allow Alice and Bob to scramble and descramble their messages so that they would appear meaningless if Eve intercepted them. Cryptography has been around for thousands of years. It has decided wars, and is at the heart of the worldwide communication network today. The fascinating story of cryptography requires us to understand two very old ideas related to number theory and probability theory."
Study computer science at Bath,-pGWKFtpyYI,CS,"If you ask anyone, what can you do with computer science they'll always just say you can do anything. Bath is just a beautiful place to study it's a really nice atmosphere. The range of modules even from the first year, doing things I'd never heard of or never thought I would be doing. We have access to the computer science department 24 hours a day. They have organised tutorials and then you have a tutor assigned to your group who help sort of lead the discussion. We had companies come in and do workshops with us. They help you all through all the stages, It feels like all the lecturers are really approachable. They push you, they guide you, in the right direction instead of giving you the straight answer. So you know how to approach different problems instead of knowing the solution to the exact problem. They do a lot of work for us so they're happy to help wherever they can. They really want to make you the best computer scientist that you can be. There's a multiple group coursework where you have to actually design and develop some software. What it looks like, or what you actually code is pretty much up to you. Me and my partner made a piano, where you press the button on one and it communicated to the other one. Some people made the cupboard and it would send a tweet. There's so much kind of creativity. It's really good with hackathons helping charities, who might not have the kind of money to make some bespoke software. The University hosted one a couple months ago called Launchpad. You're giving a specification and at the end of the 24 hours you'd have coded it and developed it it's just really nice to meet new people and also come up with new ideas. The course really gives you a good ground in the commercial environment. So it's prominent in industry right now what we learn. Our university's great reputation is having students who are really good for industrial placement. Most students that go on placements get offered a graduate scheme for when they come out which is really good for employability. I'm still supported by the University but I'm getting some real life experience before I even get the graduate market. It's all about using the tools that we have to make life better for everyone else and we've come so far. Every day the theoretical computer science becomes more practical. It's just really exciting to be involved in I just want to make a change I want to make a difference. I want to see my own contribution to computer science somewhere out there, so I'll see it someday."
Computer Science Field Guide: Computer Graphics,5kuoRjgfCls,CS,"Computer Graphics is used to create all sorts of images. But at the end of the day they're just pixels that have been given a certain colour value. Computer Scientists who work in Computer Graphics work out how to take an object, do some calculations and translate that to a computer screen. For example: we need to think about an object's rotation; its position in 3D space; and its size. [quack] This also involves specifying colours mathematically, and working out what objects should appear in front of others. And how to add shadows, and reflections. Even working out which pixels to use to draw a circle, or a line isn't that simple. In this chapter, we're going to look at some of the challenges and some of the calculations needed to get the right pixels in the right places on the screen. Computer Graphics"
Getting a Master&#39;s Degree in Computer Science,DA9JOfEOCMs,CS,"Computer Science is really the field of the twenty first century. As you look at the news and world report on the most in demand jobs, Computer  Science is always up there in the top ten. Usually the top five. The money that you can make in Computer  Science is really pretty good.  We see that each year there are more and more vacancies at companies.  Especially in the areas of Network  Security and even in Programming. If you like solving problems and making things,  a Computer Science program is ideal for you. Our students typically have an Undergraduate  Degree in Computer Science.  And students that come missing a few courses or prerequisites  could take those courses here. The advantage is that you're not just a  number. You're not just in this enormous lecture hall  where the professors don't know who you are. And I think those are the reasons why I think  it might be best to go to a school like ours. Just about every industry is dependent on technology.  Maybe in ten years from now no one is  going to be driving a car because we'll have self driving cars.  Where did self driving cars come from? Because Computer Scientists have been working on this. "
Vinesh Kannan: Computer Science,48sKPaFeyqg,CS,"Being at IIT, it's really great to have access to all of Chicago's offerings, both in technology and beyond. We've had access to 1871, the startup incubator, we've had access to Chi Hack Night, a top civic technology meetup in the city of Chicago, and countless other organizations that are designed to help people of all ages learn more about technology and how the city works. Chicago is also a great city to study computer science and data science because the city government makes unprecedent amounts of data publicly available for anyone to work on, and those have exposed us to a lot of rich and nuanced challenges that go beyond having better algorithms or better computer systems and go into deep questions about governance society and all kinds of other topics. After graduation I accepted an offer to work as a software engineer at Google. I'll be moving to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to join the team there and work on projects related to software engineering and machine learning. I'm really excited because I view that as a next step in learning more about computer science and what it means to be an engineer in today's technology climate. Before I go to Google I'll be working this summer as part of the Civic Digital Fellowship. It's a program that recruits college students to work in a federal agency for the summer, and I'll be part of a team at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in D.C. working on building models to automate paperwork about occupational codes. I'm really excited for that opportunity because I'll be the only computer scientist working on a team with economists, statisticians, and psychologists. And those are the kind of things that I'd like to do going forward. I really want to be involved in teams that are multidisciplinary and that are working on really difficult, really complex problems that impact other humans, and I hope that in the future I may be able to join or start another young company that still has time to define its culture, its approach to solving problems, and how it will be a responsible part of the technology community."
"Dr. Yihsiang Liow: Associate Professor of Computer Science, Columbia College",Q3O7Xc3gVHU,CS,"Computer Science is really everywhere. We are surrounded by computers. Now in terms of studying computer science at Columbia College, we have a small learning environment. Students interact among themselves and they have a good interaction with instructors too. So, they get to learn effectively and efficiently. Well one of my favorites would be Intro to Programming, Introduction to Programming, because that is when you get to see the new students. It is right at the beginning of the programming career or computer science career. The instructor will have a great impact and that is when perhaps interaction with students is maximal, when they are more dependent on the instructor. I think computer science is different from many other areas of study, because you have to solve problems. There is logical thinking and problem solving involved. At the same time whereas in other areas of study where you study the theory, in computer science you actually implement the theory. For instance, you can understand the logic behind a computer game and then you can write your own game. Students find that really exciting. Because of our small environment, students get to learn things effectively and efficiently. So the small environment allows us to really prepare students for their lives for professional life."
Undergraduate Computer Science at Birmingham,Gy4CiUvz2R4,CS,the biggest thing that stood out to me when i first visited was the feel and the vibe of the campus and the school computer science itself it's a really nice place to be and it's really great to explore what opportunities there are around campus even just walking through the building you can really easily talk to staff and other students and get to know them really well the main reason i chose birmingham was the open day i came onto campus and just fell in love with the place i spoke to so many students that day as well and they all just seemed so happy to be here i could tell their relationship with the staff was just amazing i was like this is the place i want to be i think that students should choose birmingham because besides the beautiful campus that we have we offer our students state-of-the-art facilities and laboratories such as dedicated robotics and cyber security labs but also to a large general purpose computer labs where our teaching happens there's lots of different societies um at the university the gilda students itself has over 300 societies and we have quite a few in the school of computer science i'm the president of computer science society and we put on lots of different events for students and staff from socials workshops to events helping you in your career but the greatest thing in my opinion we have managed to create here in our school an environment that fosters communication cooperation engagement not only between students but also between students and staff my advice to some new students would be to get involved with as many opportunities as you can whether that's joining societies or getting a summer placement they really help to enrich your experience while you're at university just come ready to make friends and with an open mind
Computer Science at the University of Exeter,Kdmo6MLliRk,CS,"My name is Ronaldo Menezes. I'm the head of the computer science department and a professor of data and network science. The misconcepts related to computer science is that people think that 'I can only do that if I know how to code' Curiosity and the ability to express your ideas is actually perhaps more important than the coding itself. But computer science is unique in a sense because it is the glue in every other area of study. In medicine computer science is important, in physics it's important, in mathematics. It is important even in the arts and humanities. You can be working in chemistry doing models of chemical reactions, you can be working on space exploration at NASA for instance. This is something that is necessary in any field. One of the things that attracted me here personally is the department of computer science is one of the fastest growing departments in the university with huge investments in terms of new staff, facilities, laboratories... Learning computer science allows you to express your ideas in a more unambiguous way. The legacy that we want to leave to our students is that they become global citizens, that they actually are able to make a difference to society wherever they go and they carry the name of the university because their legacy is our legacy."
Theoretical Computer Scientist Subhash Khot | 2016 MacArthur Fellow,n7v9psW3Qwo,CS,"My research area is the study of power and limitations of computing. In short, it is the study of what computers can do and more computers cannot do. I'm Subhas Khot. I'm a theoretical computer scientist We would like our computers to do a lot of things for us and in theoretical terms these are called designing algorithms to solve computation problems. For the last several decades, computer scientists have identified a very large class of problems. These are known as NP complete problems, which they would really like to solve fast . But now they have more or less accepted that these problems cannot be solved fast. The Unique Games Conjecture, it states that certain very specific computational problem about coloring nodes of a network to satisfy certain compatibility conditions and the conjecture states that this problem is very hard to solve and, in fact, very hard to even find. There is only approximate solutions and what the main consequence or the implication of the unique games conjecture is that, if you believe that this one specific problem is hard to solve, it implies that lots and lots of other problems, which computer scientists are very interested in, there also hard to solve. The Unique Games Conjecture it's it's not yet proven, however the research surrounding the conjecture, all these efforts, they have actually led to many many developments in computer science and mathematics. On the other hand, it's also useful that certain competition problems simply cannot be solved fast, and one such example being factoring integers. For example, if I tell you number 35 and you're supposed to find its factors, if I times  7, this cannot be solved fast for when the numbers grow really large, and it turns out that the security of almost on online systems ,let's say banking, it depends on our belief that nobody knows how to factor integers fast. So the Unique Games Conjecture it led to quite surprising discovery in entirely unexpected area of research. We know what elections are and often the result of an election is simply decided by majority vote, Uf there are two candidates, then whichever candidate gets more votes wins. The Unique Games Conjecture, it led to the reason that this votingscheme is stable under noise, meaning even if the words where  miscountered or maybe there was little bit of noise in recording the votes. It won't really change the the winner of the election by much. For several years, I have been trying to make progress on proving the Unique Games Conjecture ,and in the last four or five years me along with my coauthors, we do have a quite promising approaches that I'm excited about. I personally have started believing that we do have actually an approach to prove it and I'm I'm excited in following these approaches and I see where these go."
Computer Science Field Guide: Introduction,v5yeq5u2RMI,CS,"Welcome to our guide to Computer Science. One of the main reasons that we've created this guide is that although computers are a big part of our lives and in the world all around us, A lot of people don't really understand what Computer Science is. I was going to take Computer Science but, I basically already know how to use Word and Excel. And it is one of those things that you don't really notice until it's missing. For example then you end up with things like really. Slow. Programs. Or, incredibly, frustrating, interfaces. Or, systems, that can't cope with large amounts of data. And these days, a business can become a thousand times bigger overnight. That's exactly when you need it to be able to cope with a lot of data. We'll look at topics like: Computer Security, to make sure that any personal information you're holding can't be accessed by hackers; or Artificial Intelligence, for planning and decision making; Computer Graphics, for entertainment and also visualising large amounts of data; and Computer Vision, where a computer can sense objects and even people in the world around it. We'll look at computer programs that take so long to run that they won't finish in a lifetime, even on the fastest computer. We'll think about what it means for a computer to be intelligent. And we'll look at how compression works so that we can take thousands of songs and fit them on a device that's small enough to fit in your pocket. Computer Science is many things to many people, and after working through this guide, you'll have a better idea of what Computer Science is, and especially how we can use it to design software that will help people in their everyday lives."
Become A Computer Science Teacher,9VvuRiFQv10,CS,"There's so many computer science jobs out there that are not being filled. So the more computer science teachers we have in our school systems the more students we will be able to reach. And getting past that initial fear of what computer sciences is, is what's gonna change the whole field of computer science. The curriculum is very accessible to first-time teachers. I think it's also accessible to experienced teachers. If you didn't have any background knowledge of computers, technology, computer science whatever the case may be, you can successfully teach this course. So it's great. Having lots of teachers in the classroom will give us the ability to adapt to a future that frankly none of us can predict. The workplace has changed. Education has to change. And this is all part of helping to prepare students for the world that they're going to work in. If you have an interest you need to go for it! And you need to do that really not just for yourself but certainly to benefit your students. They need stuff that is relevant and this... I think this is it. Yeah."
Shaun’s story - MSc Computer Science,_CCCPHkwb24,CS,"I just want to keep my options open. When I was doing my A-levels it was the same thing. Always just looking for the broadest avenue that I could take. My undergrad, I did a psychology degree which I actually did here, at the University of Bath. It was a good all-round degree that allowed me to explore lots different things. So I went looking for jobs  and landed myself in a summer job. I liked the work I was doing but at the same time a lot of the software that we were using,  they're quite outdated, very little support for them. I found that quite frustrating. I'd always been sort of interested in computer science and it definitely inspired me to learn and maybe find myself in a role one day where I could be building systems that could help people. The course is quite collaborative and fosters this sort of environment where you're always sharing ideas and talking to people and everybody on this course wants to do well and wants everyone else to do well. The lecturers were always made themselves available. I chose to do the module called  Intelligent Control and Cognitive Systems and we were building robots out of Lego and setting them off so to roam around the room and I've enjoyed all the coding that we've done on the course,  I find it a good challenge. A Computer Science degree is just so sought after, so valued. And think that's what I've found pretty much everywhere that I've gone. Now people are like knocking on my door. The world thrives on data these days, you know. It's the most valuable asset that you can have. The study of computer science holds the answers to the questions that you might not even be facing yet. You're designing something that's making someone's life in some way, easier. You do something that you  have a sense of ownership over. Just how can you top that as a feeling?"
First Things First: Why I Study Computer Science | UConn,s_C9yE1588A,CS,the first programming language  I had exposure to was Python and this was really cool experience for me because  it was the first time I got to you know type some words on a page and it would actually be something that would function you'd see like you see words popping up you could make it interactive you you just have a whole bunch of different logical like ifs and aliases and then you can make an entire game out of it so  this experience in high school was what really led me to look into computer science at UConn and once I got in a tour got to meet some of the professors  I really knew it would be a great fit since I've started here  it's been amazing I've gotten more experience in Python I've got experience in C and Java  and I just love all of it it's all different ways of using logic to be creative and make something that works

Unplugged - What is Computer Science?,HsXaVV6fFDY,CS,"What do you want to be when you grow up Olivia? Umm, an astronaut! Do you happen to know what a computer programmer is? Yeahh, umm, no. Umm, what what? I'm not really sure how to explain it. Computer programming is pretty simple. It's a set of instructions, like a recipe. You have to follow them step by step to get the end result you want. Computer science is a way to impact the world. It can be music videos, it can be games, detect whether or not someone is related to someone else. Find you know, people's friends. You can do all sorts of other crazy things that actually save lives. You do have to have a drive I think. It is to me like a paintbrush. I think great programming is not all that dissimilar from great art. When I finally learned a little bit of programming, that blank wall resolved into a bunch of doors and you open them and of course then you find behind them is another hallway filled with a bunch of doors. Programming is fun and easy. You can do anything your mind wants to do. Finally you start to open enough doors the light comes in. To me a finished program is like a structure filled with light. All the corners are illuminated. The number of people that you can touch and interact with is something the world has never seen before. Our first lesson in this series is all about what computer science is, what a computer scientist does and how you can be more responsible in your use of technology. It's a very important lesson but it is a little text-heavy. At the end, you get to make your very own customized encoding using your initials. It's a fun activity and it's very empowering because binary is one of those things that feels very technical but once you understand it, it's like you speak a secret language."
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic | Computer Science | Khan Academy,8CluknrLeys,CS,"Imagine we are living in prehistoric times. Now, consider the following. How did we keep track of time without a clock? All clocks are based on some repetitive pattern which divides the flow of time into equal segments. To find these repetitive patterns, we look towards the heavens. The sun rising and falling each day is the most obvious. However, to keep track of longer periods of time, we looked for longer cycles. For this we looked to the moon, which seemed to gradually grow and shrink over many days. When we count the number of days between full moons, we arrive at the number 29. This is the origin of a month. However, if we try to divide 29 into equal pieces, we run into a problem. It is impossible. The only way to divide 29 into equal pieces is to break it back down into single units. 29 is a prime number. Think of it as unbreakable. If a number can be broken down into equal pieces greater than one, we call it a composite number. Now, if we are curious, we may wonder how many prime numbers are there, and how big do they get? Let's start by dividing all numbers into two categories. We list the primes on the left, and the composites on the right. At first they seem to dance back and forth. There is no obvious pattern here. So let's use a modern technique to see the big picture. The trick is to use a Ulam spiral. First we list all possible numbers in order in a growing spiral. Then we color all the prime numbers blue. Finally, we zoom out to see millions of numbers. This is the pattern of primes, which goes on and on forever. Incredibly, the entire structure of this pattern is still unsolved today. We are on to something. So let's fast forward to around 300 BC in ancient Greece. A philosopher known as Euclid of Alexandria understood that all numbers could be split into these two distinct categories. He began by realizing that any number can be divided down over and over until you reach a group of smallest equal numbers. And by definition, these smallest numbers are always prime numbers. So he knew that all numbers are somehow built out of smaller primes. To be clear, imagine the universe of all numbers, and ignore the primes. Now, pick any composite number and break it down, and you are always left with prime numbers. So Euclid knew that every number could be expressed using a group of smaller primes. Think of these as building blocks. No matter what number you choose, it can always be built with an addition of smaller primes. This is the root of his discovery, known as the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, as follows. Take any number, say 30, and find all the prime numbers it divides into equally. This we know as factorization. This will give us the prime factors. In this case, 2, 3, and 5 are the prime factors of 30. Euclid realized that you could then multiply these prime factors a specific number of times to build the original number. In this case, you simply multiply each factor once to build 30. 2 times 3 times 5 is the prime factorization of 30. Think of it as a special key, or combination. There is no other way to build 30 using some other groups of prime numbers multiplied together. So every possible number has one, and only one prime factorization. A good analogy is to imagine each number as a different lock. The unique key for each lock would be its prime factorization. No two locks share a key. No two numbers share a prime factorization."
Intro to Computer Science &amp; Programming Using Python: 6.00.1x | MITx on edX | About Video,ww2BdhILIio,CS,"JOHN GUTTAG: Computational devices have become so pervasive that most of the time we don't even realize that we're using them. Computation keeps our planes in the air and our cars on the road. It manages our electrical, communications, and financial systems. It controls everything from homes to pacemakers. And most importantly, computation has changed the way people think about the world. Hello. My name is John Guttag, and I want to tell you a little something about the course Introduction to Computation and Programming in Python. On the surface, this course may appear to be just another introduction to programming in Python. But if that's all you get out of it, I'll be very disappointed. In particular, you should come away from this course with a good start on understanding how to use computation to solve real problems. The idea is to simultaneously Python, how to be a good programmer, and do both of these in the context of solving problems of genuine interest. Now for some truth in advertising. Like all good engineering courses, this course is mostly about learning by doing. We've worked hard at preparing the online lecture material. But truth be told, you'll learn a lot more by doing the problem sets and attempt to apply the things we've talked about in the lectures. If you've never programed before, you're in for a treat. It may take you a little while to get the hang of it, but once you do, you'll discover that programming is an enormous amount of fun."

Graduate Computer Science at Towson University,VfVCHq6RuYE,CS,"I was a technician at a signal intelligence firm. As I started learning skills here, they started using me for my programming abilities, and that led to raises and what responsibilities in the eventual promotions. Students in our program develop a well-rounded background in computer science. We offer a number of career tracks including software engineering, computer security, and e-commerce.  I was really focused into what I will need in the industry and the real-life job. Towson University has prepared me for my career, and I'm really thankful for that."
Computer Science on the Court,Vh2lg3RL7vE,CS,"I'm Jeremy Thompson. I'm a member of the Men's Cross Country team and I am a computer science student at the UPEI School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences. So the research that I was involved in looks at athletic movements and analyzing people's movements. So the way that we analyze people's movements is by gathering EMG signals with sensors that wrap around your forearm and provide activation signals of how much the muscle is firing. We can look at the readings from that and compare that to a model and essentially provide feedback. I've always been involved in sports, whether it be basketball or running, and this really allowed me to tie in my computer science knowledge to something that I was genuinely interested in. The thing I like most about computer science is the amount of opportunities that it provides you. You really have opportunities to work in whatever field you're interested in. Computer Science nowadays is finding its way into everything from athletics to analytics to anything else you can imagine I love the amount of opportunities that it gives you."
Meet a Computer Science Major: Kate Uffer,815ZMRHPCYo,CS,"The key factor in choosing to study computer science here at Manhattan College, was the family feel of the department. When I came here to Accepted Students Day and we got to meet all the professors and they're all really interested, not only in their research, but also in the development of their students. And when I saw that, coming in, I was like, this is a department that I want to be able to work with. Growing up, I really always loved playing video games. As I got older, I was like, man I really wanna make some of these. I did one of those little game-making camps over the summer and I was like, this is what I wanna do. The program here at Manhattan College is really great. For your first two years you end up learning programming and programming languages, the real basics of computer science. And then in your junior and senior year, you branch out into more of the theory of different areas of computer science, such as computer networks and operating systems. And then in your senior year, it's more of free electives, so you're able to learn more about concentrations within computer science, such as parallel computing and virtualization, and data structure and algorithms. My most rewarding experience here at Manhattan College so far is being able to apply what I've learned outside the classroom. I took a web programming course in sophomore year where I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript, and I've been able to bring that to the WRCM radio station here that we have on campus. It's an internet radio station, we stream freely over the internet, we have a website that's attached to that, and in my sophomore year I became the shadow webmaster so I learned all the inner workings of the website. Junior year, I took control, and was able to customize it to my liking. And in my senior year I'm looking forward to bring new advancements to the site to make it more user-friendly, visually appealing, and hopefully bring it to a wider audience. If you're looking for a program with dedicated professors and a tight-knit community of students, Manhattan College's computer science program is definitely a program to consider."
JHU Computer Science: The Undergraduate Experience,Asj3XaBiIXU,CS,"I'm amazed at how entrepreneurial Hopkins undergraduates are. When I get a new freshman advisee, they often come into my office with a plan and an app and a company. This is amazing. This major has tripled in size since the time that I got here. And we are definitely at the forefront of very hot topic fields like data science. Our students, when they graduate from our program, even at the undergraduate level, are pretty well sought after. From a number of the big name companies that you would expect for computer scientists. One of the most amazing things about Hopkins engineers is just our passion and drive to learn and apply what we're learning in class."
Computer Science at the University of Exeter,Kdmo6MLliRk,CS,"My name is Ronaldo Menezes. I'm the head of the computer science department and a professor of data and network science. The misconcepts related to computer science is that people think that 'I can only do that if I know how to code' Curiosity and the ability to express your ideas is actually perhaps more important than the coding itself. But computer science is unique in a sense because it is the glue in every other area of study. In medicine computer science is important, in physics it's important, in mathematics. It is important even in the arts and humanities. You can be working in chemistry doing models of chemical reactions, you can be working on space exploration at NASA for instance. This is something that is necessary in any field. One of the things that attracted me here personally is the department of computer science is one of the fastest growing departments in the university with huge investments in terms of new staff, facilities, laboratories... Learning computer science allows you to express your ideas in a more unambiguous way. The legacy that we want to leave to our students is that they become global citizens, that they actually are able to make a difference to society wherever they go and they carry the name of the university because their legacy is our legacy."
Doctoral Research in Computer Science,G3rW3UiZr9Q,CS,"I'm working on a project called PacMan,  it's a robot manipulation project and we have partners in Italy and Austria. PacMan is about making Boris, our robot, be able to load the dishwasher, using a unfamiliar objects and my specific role in this project is involves developing object representations for Boris to see what he has got on the table in front of him and to locate them to see what pose they are in their environment and things like that. Studying for PhD involves a lot of different skills coming together from you, it requires lots of collaboration, you collaborate with people in your project, which helps you to be a good team player, it involves a lot of problem solving and analytical skills, so you to analyse what situation you are in and you have to come up with good solutions to get out of that situation. In Birmingham, working with world-class professors and colleagues, so that means you have a lot of people who think outside the box and who can give a great push and help to your workplace and to your research as well. The work environment here is great, it pushes you forward, definitely. You'll never feel like an outsider, because it's so international and also, the good thing is that we live in a great campus. After the PhD, I want to go straight into industry, and a well-planned PhD can help you do that because you're basically developing algorithms and theories and applying them to practical situations, which consists of problems that are important now and they're going to be important in the future as well. For example, in the robotics field, we are going to have robots all around the world, all around our world, in ten years or fifteen years or so, so if you get a PhD in robotics or about vision, it is going to help you to make an impact on the community later as well."
Major in Computer Science - Noah,-XzLwhyjuN4,CS,"(walkie talkie noises) - On Site of an incident, There are a lot of firefighters that the incident commander would need to keep track of, after the fact, if anyone's hurt, or there's any accidents during the incident, then it's important to be able to tell who was where, at what time, and everything that was going on. for my senior design project, we're working with the Berea fire department to develop an app to assist with the accountability and management. For instance, We are looking at developing this application so that it'll provide that management to keep track of all the firefighters on scene, as well as reports afterwards, to handle the accountability. This was the first React Native project that I've worked on. ""React Native"" is a programming framework running native code that can be launched on both iOS and Android. One of the priorities when we were developing this application, was accessibility for them looking into the applications that they already have in use making them stylistically similar, a lot of the same elements so that they feel comfortable with the application. Being on a team can sometimes be difficult, but I think that if you manage it properly and you're all on the same page and working together, then it's a real blessing and it's nice to not have everything rely on you. One of my group members, Jarrett managed a lot of testing and metrics lead designer in the report aspect. Lee did a lot of work on the functionality that the Berea fire department was looking for. When you're doing a project for yourself you have your own expectations, and working with the clients been really nice. It's really good to be able to get that instant feedback. You know, whenever you're delivering a good product and they're happy with it's a really good feeling. (gentle music)"

Master of Science in Computer Science: A Distinctive Program Creates Exceptional Graduates,D6uDVv4de-M,CS,"""One of the unique things about our computer science program is that we have the areas of cybersecurity and digital forensics and networks that really help build up your computer science skills in today's society. We don't focus on one programming language. Many universities when you go to their curriculum you see that 'you know what we're just gonna teach them C, right? We have a different philosophy here at the University of New Haven. We think and we know in fact that by the time you graduate you're going to have to know multiple programming languages therefore by the time you graduate you must have at least experienced three programming languages, including Python which has been rated recently as one of the most used programming languages. We have for example a course in Introduction to Digital Forensics. We have a course in mobile device forensics. We have another course that's in reverse engineering. These are courses that will prepare you 100% to enter the workforce."""
Augusta University Computer Science Passion with Justin DeShong,cuPLq1uuc5w,CS,"I chose Augusta University because of the fact that they had computer science major and that's something I wanted to do. It's like a home to me. Growing up I was a gamer and I basically still am a gamer so I really appreciate gaming and stuff. So it's also a chance to get to learn how to make the game itself. It started in my first computer programming class that took. I really enjoyed that and also just seeing other people play it. You know, it's good to say like 'I participate in making that game or making that code.' It's really helpful whenever I code or whenever I work on a project maybe I talk to a friend and say 'hey it's this really cool or do you suggest anything?' I'm trying to work on this the best I can. It's always good to have somebody fresh that doesn't see the same thing and everybody sees the world differently and that's really good to have because there's gonna be mistakes that you probably can't see but they will see and tell you. The faculty is just amazing, for real. I have a good relationship with most of them. They're really helpful. They really explain a lot when I was going into my first computer science courses. One thing that really impacted me was probably being called back as a technical counselor in the Gen Cyber Program at Augusta University. Being able to come back and just seeing like both sides of the window, both sides as a counselor and a student, it was really really interesting and I really had fun with it. One of my other activities is actually I'm enrolled in the Augusta University Wind Ensemble and the Augusta University Jaguar pep band. It is kind of like using both sides of my brain. It's always good to do something else that you enjoy. Being Boundless means working your challenging areas. I do have some challenging areas and when I first started coding but I tried to learn that and I try to refresh myself. I know it's gonna be challenging so you might as start on the challenging things rather than just waiting until you need it.  "
"Dr. Yihsiang Liow: Associate Professor of Computer Science, Columbia College",Q3O7Xc3gVHU,CS,"Computer Science is really everywhere. We are surrounded by computers. Now in terms of studying computer science at Columbia College, we have a small learning environment. Students interact among themselves and they have a good interaction with instructors too. So, they get to learn effectively and efficiently. Well one of my favorites would be Intro to Programming, Introduction to Programming, because that is when you get to see the new students. It is right at the beginning of the programming career or computer science career. The instructor will have a great impact and that is when perhaps interaction with students is maximal, when they are more dependent on the instructor. I think computer science is different from many other areas of study, because you have to solve problems. There is logical thinking and problem solving involved. At the same time whereas in other areas of study where you study the theory, in computer science you actually implement the theory. For instance, you can understand the logic behind a computer game and then you can write your own game. Students find that really exciting. Because of our small environment, students get to learn things effectively and efficiently. So the small environment allows us to really prepare students for their lives for professional life."
Study computer science at Bath,-pGWKFtpyYI,CS,"If you ask anyone, what can you do with computer science they'll always just say you can do anything. Bath is just a beautiful place to study it's a really nice atmosphere. The range of modules even from the first year, doing things I'd never heard of or never thought I would be doing. We have access to the computer science department 24 hours a day. They have organised tutorials and then you have a tutor assigned to your group who help sort of lead the discussion. We had companies come in and do workshops with us. They help you all through all the stages, It feels like all the lecturers are really approachable. They push you, they guide you, in the right direction instead of giving you the straight answer. So you know how to approach different problems instead of knowing the solution to the exact problem. They do a lot of work for us so they're happy to help wherever they can. They really want to make you the best computer scientist that you can be. There's a multiple group coursework where you have to actually design and develop some software. What it looks like, or what you actually code is pretty much up to you. Me and my partner made a piano, where you press the button on one and it communicated to the other one. Some people made the cupboard and it would send a tweet. There's so much kind of creativity. It's really good with hackathons helping charities, who might not have the kind of money to make some bespoke software. The University hosted one a couple months ago called Launchpad. You're giving a specification and at the end of the 24 hours you'd have coded it and developed it it's just really nice to meet new people and also come up with new ideas. The course really gives you a good ground in the commercial environment. So it's prominent in industry right now what we learn. Our university's great reputation is having students who are really good for industrial placement. Most students that go on placements get offered a graduate scheme for when they come out which is really good for employability. I'm still supported by the University but I'm getting some real life experience before I even get the graduate market. It's all about using the tools that we have to make life better for everyone else and we've come so far. Every day the theoretical computer science becomes more practical. It's just really exciting to be involved in I just want to make a change I want to make a difference. I want to see my own contribution to computer science somewhere out there, so I'll see it someday."
How does my Computer Science background fit at the CIA?,76CaXkJr3Wk,CS,"If you're like me, you want to use your computer science skills for something meaningful — something bigger than yourself. The CIA is the perfect place to make this happen. Here, your talents make it possible for us to safeguard the national security of America through the collection and production of critical foreign intelligence for the President and senior policymakers. When I come to work each day, I know that I am contributing to a mission greater than myself. If you're a computer scientist, you might be wondering where you fit in at the CIA. A variety of opportunities are available that fit your background. You could develop, test, implement and maintain complex Agency applications, systems and services as an Apps Developer.

"Shock Doc: Zubair Khan, computer science major",HMRzxyQPspQ,CS,"My name is Zubair Khan, I am currently a a third year student here at Wichita State studying computer science. I'm actually interning at NetApp right now which is a company that handles a lot of data  and data management. When I came into Wichita State as a freshman, I knew I wanted to go into something related to CS, although I wasn't terribly sure what I should do for that. So I went to the Career Development Center one day, they helped me make my resume,  helped me polish it to make sure that it was all good and after that they showed me how to use Handshake. Ultimately, I actually found an internship  at NetApp that I liked a lot. I've been at NetApp since March of 2017. The team I'm on does Quality Assurance, meaning that we go ahead  and we deal with our firmware as well as some of our software. Just to make sure that everything's working as it should. So with Wichita State, that's been really helpful because being able to live in Wichita,  being able to go to classes, and being able to find an employer where I'm learning these real-world abilities while balancing class  has been really important. So it's all thanks to the Career Development Center and making sure I was able to find those connections there."
What is cryptography? | Journey into cryptography | Computer Science | Khan Academy,Kf9KjCKmDcU,CS,"Imagine two people who share an important secret have to split up. This requires them to communicate private information from a distance. However, an eavesdropper named Eve also wants this information, and has the ability to intercept their messages. So, Alice decides to communicate using letters written in some kind of secret code. The following analogy is helpful. First, Alice locks her message in a box, using a lock that only she and Bob know the combination to. This is known as 'encryption.' Then, the locked message is sent to Bob. When Bob receives the box, he opens it using the code they shared in advance. This is called 'decryption.' Cryptography begins when we abandon physical locks and use 'ciphers' instead. Think of [ciphers] as virtual locks. Ciphers allow Alice and Bob to scramble and descramble their messages so that they would appear meaningless if Eve intercepted them. Cryptography has been around for thousands of years. It has decided wars, and is at the heart of the worldwide communication network today. The fascinating story of cryptography requires us to understand two very old ideas related to number theory and probability theory."
Oxford University Department of Computer Science tour,uRyJ8CCNhno,CS,"Hiya my name is Maninder and i'm an undergraduate here at   the Department of Computer Science.  Come on in and i'll show you around.   Welcome to one of the oldest computer science departments in the country. Established in 1957,   back then we used to be called the Oxford  University Computing Laboratory.  Now the department   is home to a community of world-class teaching and research. This space right here is the atrium, which   which we not only use for social gatherings and events, such as coding workshops and department parties ,  but I personally like to come here after  lectures just to finish off some of my work. This is Lecture Theatre B.  Students come here for lectures no matter which Oxford college they go to .  Any students that have computer science lectures as part of their undergraduate degree, be that in   computer science and philosophy, computer science, or maths and computer science will come here   for lectures. This is one of our practical  labs and depending on which courses you take   you might be here for about two afternoons a week.  All of our machines run linux and every   student has their own account for which they can save their files and access them remotely.   This is Lecture Theatre A, the second of  our lecture theatres, and not only do we   use this space for weekly lectures, but we often host industry tech talks.  This gives companies   and organizations a chance to tell us some of the interesting things that they're working on.   It's way more interesting than your average  recruiting pitch and we often get free pizza. This is the undergraduate social area which  is used by our students between lectures    and for project work.  Here you have access to wi-fi, computers and free tea and coffee in the kitchen.   This space is also used by the Oxford University   Computer Society, where they run a bunch  of events and socials throughout the year.   Thank you so much for visiting us  and I really hope you enjoyed the   tour. If you have any other questions  you can visit us at:  www.cs.ox.ac.uk"
Online Master&#39;s in Computer Science - Indrakshi Ray- Colorado State University Online,QyI4HHM2Vg4,CS,"I'm Indrakshi Ray and I’m a professor at the computer science department here at CSU. Computer Science has to do with encoding, storing, tracking and transforming information. And this information is being generated everywhere these days in various forms and formats. You know, “how can you manage all of this information."" Computer Science impacts almost all the sectors you can think of. The financial sector, the transportation sector, the healthcare sector, and of course, you know, commerce and business. Initially I was looking for an online master’s degree so I wouldn't have to quit my job and go to a campus. I wanted to continue my career and fit a master's degree into my life. Computer Science is pretty diverse, so the students do have flexibility in choosing their sub-specialization areas. The thing that differentiates a master's degree from a bachelor's degree is that the exposure to novel research done by researchers in the field. As a student in the master's program they get you know, to work with professors doing world-class research, as well as they themselves get to work on these research components and so they learn from this research and get to see what's to come and also be a part of it. I really enjoyed the master's in computer science program. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a master's degree in computer science. We need very many different kinds of students so together we can do something that is very meaningful and which is likely to change the world."

Shaun’s story - MSc Computer Science,_CCCPHkwb24,CS,"I just want to keep my options open. When I was doing my A-levels it was the same thing. Always just looking for the broadest avenue that I could take. My undergrad, I did a psychology degree which I actually did here, at the University of Bath. It was a good all-round degree that allowed me to explore lots different things. So I went looking for jobs  and landed myself in a summer job. I liked the work I was doing but at the same time a lot of the software that we were using,  they're quite outdated, very little support for them. I found that quite frustrating. I'd always been sort of interested in computer science and it definitely inspired me to learn and maybe find myself in a role one day where I could be building systems that could help people. The course is quite collaborative and fosters this sort of environment where you're always sharing ideas and talking to people and everybody on this course wants to do well and wants everyone else to do well. The lecturers were always made themselves available. I chose to do the module called  Intelligent Control and Cognitive Systems and we were building robots out of Lego and setting them off so to roam around the room and I've enjoyed all the coding that we've done on the course,  I find it a good challenge. A Computer Science degree is just so sought after, so valued. And think that's what I've found pretty much everywhere that I've gone. Now people are like knocking on my door. The world thrives on data these days, you know. It's the most valuable asset that you can have. The study of computer science holds the answers to the questions that you might not even be facing yet. You're designing something that's making someone's life in some way, easier. You do something that you  have a sense of ownership over. Just how can you top that as a feeling?"
First Step - Intro to Computer Science,N8dKtrrCZ7U,CS,"So I think the best answer is the second choice, that we should make really sure that we understand the problem before we progress on trying to solve it. I'll talk next on what it means to understand a problem and how to do that, but let me go through the other answers before. It's often tempting to start writing code too early. Writing code is fun and that's what we like to do as programmers and computer scientists. The problem with starting to write code before we understand a problem, is we might write the wrong code. We might get very frustrated trying to write code before we really understand the problem or how to solve it. Or we might end up writing a lot of code that doesn't actually solve the problem we wanted to solve. The third choice is actually a very good answer, if this weren't a practice problem. If it's a practice problem, you're going to learn a lot more by trying to solve it yourself than finding an existing answer. And then maybe understanding the answer, you'll still learn something. You'll learn a lot more by trying to solve things yourself. If it weren't a practice problem and you just wanted to solve this, and move onto the next thing, searching to see if someone has already solved the problem. And for a problem like this, probably there are good solutions out there already, is a better use of your time than writing your own solution. Unless your goal is to learn something by writing your own solution. The fourth place to start working on an algorithm also depends on understanding the problem. Until we understand the problem well, we don't know what algorithm we need to create."
Computer Science at DeSales University,HkZlOsJQWlw,CS,"At DeSales University we offer a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science through our department of Mathematics Computer Science. The computer science degree blends the foundational skills needed in both the theoretical and the information science fields we also have two specialized tracks in computer science one is in game programming the second is in digital art our game programming students get a blend of both the creative side and the programming theoretical side and that skill set is not just for programming games but our graduates and game programming have gone on to jobs within the healthcare industry doing simulations working to use their game programming skills to do educational programs as well as in any of the information science fields. Our track and digital art provides students the opportunity to learn both the creative graphic design in two dimensions but also the 3d animation. So our students often will collaborate with our TV film students and doing the animation. Having been a computer science major, I get to work hands-on with some of the newest products and applying for jobs now computer skills are so important because most things are moving online or they're moving to digital and I believe that that gives a student greater advantage. If you're interested in majoring in computer science I definitely recommend visiting DeSales and seeing for yourself the beauty of the campus and just the atmosphere. Interact with students, ask them questions, meet the faculty, sit in our class or go to a club meeting just to see for yourself how awesome it really is here."
Computer Science MSc Part 1,ZVcRmpJe8Q4,CS,"You know I've done some travelling before  and I decided that Hungary was right for me.  I feel good now, I feel quite happy.  Eotvos Lorand University offers various programs in Computer Science  ...bachelor's level, master's level, even at PhD level.  I'm a student of the EIT Digital program in the Software and Service Architecture track This service arquitecture is a big deal now in this area and growing a lot. So the demand of these people is also growing a lot.  I study advanced cryptography, specialized in security but I wanted to major at this university because  this university is very good in math and because math is important for my degree. Then if you need to study cryptography, I think you should come here. Plenty of professors know very much in depth about some of the computers aspects that in any other parts of the world they don't know well. And they are scientists.  and here I learn more about theory.  At the same time, I am staying in this edge which I call of the practical and the theory because  that's the so-called ""movers and shakers of the world"". You really have to stay on that edge. If you are doing something too theoretical, then maybe it doesn't help the world for a hundred years. And if it's too practical, then you're just probably copying whatever everybody else is doing. So there is this kind of unique place to stay.  But actually, I am an engineer so I like to know many things about theory and put them in practice so that  I can solve the problems of everyday life; so I really like that. There are lot of specialties here that  you can't find anywhere else in the world. The teachers are really supportive, the content of their academic program is very good. There's a lot of research going on; so it was a good decision.  And it changed modes a little over to the science area and I kind of love the way that ELTE kind of molds you into having this more scientific perspective. The major advantage of our master's program is that about half of the courses are given  in small groups so the students can have a really tight connection to the professors. We help our students develop not only their professional but also interpersonal skills. This degree is really advantageous for those who wants to start their own companies  and want to develop their own ideas. You can improve your skills with different people, different knowledge, and multicultural environment. Most of the students who come here are generally pretty serious and devoted students, which I think is kind of important because you're like a bit of a team  and you are gonna be with those same people for a couple of years. If you wanna come to study here in Hungary, ELTE, you should maybe look a little bit at the specialties. They are very specialized in some topics, in some very specific topics,  especially in the algorithms at the field of biology where computing systems are everywhere. These are pretty unique opportunities and if you find these types of things interesting, then I would say definitely  the program here will allow you to grow in these various areas. "
Protocols - Intro to Computer Science,0U31-O4oEPc,CS,"And what we need to make a network work is a Protocol. And what a protocol is, a set of rules that people agree to, that tell you how two entities can talk to each other. So, for the web, the protocol gives rules about how a client and a server talk to each other. The client is the web browser and the server, is the web server. So that might be udacity dot com. The web browser is what you're running at home. And what the protocol says is, if you want to get the server to do something, the client has to send a message in a particular way. The protocol that we use on the web, is called hypertext transfer proto, protocol. Which is abbreviated as HTTP. When you look in your browser, almost all the URLs that you use start with HTTP. That indicates that the protocol, that you should use to talk to the sever, that you're requesting a document from, is this protocol, called hyper text transfer protocol. An it's a very simple protocol. There aren't, too many messages. There's actually only two main messages and there is only one, we'll talk about. That's the message called GET. The client can send a message to the server, where the message says get, and then the name of that object that you want to get. So that's all the client does. It sense the message like this, and if you remember the python code for get page. Well, let's call in some library function that actually does this. That's sending the get message to the server. The server will get that message. It will do some, run some code on it. It will find a file that was requested. It might run some more code to get the result. Take the web application course to understand more about what the server does, but what matters to the client, and what matters to us in using this, is what happens after that. The server sends back a response, which is the contents of the requested object. So that's the whole protocol, that's what's going on whether you send a web request using your browser, by clicking on a link. Well then the browsers doing a lot of things to figure out what you requested and then its sending a get message to the right web server. That was the server specified by the URL, to know which server it is, and then its getting a response and its doing processing on that response to render it. If you want to understand more about what the web browser is doing, take the programming languages class that focuses on how to build a web browser."
Computer Science Undergraduate Research at the University of Iowa,UzjJ1zmDMfs,CS,"Computing lets you explore, understand  and amplify human abilities in essentially every domain. Instead of using a wet lab, I use computers. You have to find something that you're interested in enough to work on every day, even though you won't be seeing results every day How do you attack and solve complex problems knowing how to do that is an incredibly valuable lifelong skill. The calculations I'm running are very complex and they take a lot of time. I could run them on my desktop computer it would just take exponentially more time to complete and I could run it on  thousands of computers and have resulted in four days instead of a month or two. you can treat a patient based on their personal genetic makeup and I think that's something that's also really exciting because you know that you're contributing something that can help people and make a difference"
Is a Computer Science Degree Worth It?,ShNrn6KPWUk,CS,"I chose the computer science degree program at SNHU because I am a self-taught engineer. I started learning code at 35. It was a struggle from the get go and I watched some of my colleagues level up their skills faster and move on to bigger and better positions while I frankly got bogged down trying to learn some of the basics. And I knew that the best way to shore up the deficiencies was to get an actual education. My name is Jeff DeWitt and I'm a graduate of Southern New Hampshire University. I've known a couple of people who have actually attended SNHU and SNHU has a big reputation. So not only was there a computer science degree program that I could pursue completely, 100% online whenever I wanted to go, but they offered different specialties, too, so I could I could hone in on different things if I wanted to. The way the degree program is kind of set up in the way that I guess the institution itself supports students, I felt that I always had somebody in my corner. It was the way in which my advisors were constantly reaching out to me, checking to see if I needed anything. The instructors themselves were always available and the interactions that I had with my fellow classmates was phenomenal. I still keep in touch with a couple close friends that I made at school when I finally completed my degree program. I definitely missed it at first, and it seems surreal. Not only did I get the degree that I wanted to get, but I got the GPA that I worked so hard to get. And then you go to the actual ceremony and you are in the auditorium with all of the other students who are graduating. And it's one of those feelings that, you know, is a pretty rare experience and that you're going to remember for the rest of your life. I got hired the same month as I graduated. I landed a fully remote, full stack developer position working for the federal government at every step of the way. I felt like people were there to offer support and to reinforce that they are willing to work with me to help me accomplish my goals. SNHU empowers you to build the future that you want. You just need to get started."
Unplugged - What is Computer Science?,HsXaVV6fFDY,CS,"What do you want to be when you grow up Olivia? Umm, an astronaut! Do you happen to know what a computer programmer is? Yeahh, umm, no. Umm, what what? I'm not really sure how to explain it. Computer programming is pretty simple. It's a set of instructions, like a recipe. You have to follow them step by step to get the end result you want. Computer science is a way to impact the world. It can be music videos, it can be games, detect whether or not someone is related to someone else. Find you know, people's friends. You can do all sorts of other crazy things that actually save lives. You do have to have a drive I think. It is to me like a paintbrush. I think great programming is not all that dissimilar from great art. When I finally learned a little bit of programming, that blank wall resolved into a bunch of doors and you open them and of course then you find behind them is another hallway filled with a bunch of doors. Programming is fun and easy. You can do anything your mind wants to do. Finally you start to open enough doors the light comes in. To me a finished program is like a structure filled with light. All the corners are illuminated. The number of people that you can touch and interact with is something the world has never seen before. Our first lesson in this series is all about what computer science is, what a computer scientist does and how you can be more responsible in your use of technology. It's a very important lesson but it is a little text-heavy. At the end, you get to make your very own customized encoding using your initials. It's a fun activity and it's very empowering because binary is one of those things that feels very technical but once you understand it, it's like you speak a secret language."
CS,yGTMDbTmo5k,CS,"The reason I chose computer science is because  there's technology everywhere right now,   and that's only going to increase. And  I figured if that's going to be the way   that it is, I want to know how to use it,  how to create it and how to modify it,   if I can. I am pursuing computer science because  the thought of creating something that could   eventually impact the world and leave a foot print  just at the tips of your fingers really excites   me. You know? With a couple of lines of code  you could really leave an impact on the world."
Josh Caratelli | Computer Science | RMIT University,SHsHiq2q0zk,CS,"So I really love computer science because it's a great mix of working with fantastic people and combining technical and creative skills. I've always been a huge gamer, I love playing games and the social interactions you have with games and it wasn't I met game developers in person that I realised how passionate and creative and just awesome they were; that I went, hang on I'd love to do this as a job. My name's Josh Cartelli, I'm studying at RMIT University doing second year computer science and my day job is a junior  gameplay programmer at big ant studios. RMIT was a very obvious choice for me for a couple of reasons. The first being just the culture, the people here are super nice, super passionate if you have an issue or if you want to extend yourself RMIT's there for you. And secondly, in my field of computer science and game development, people overseas have heard of RMIT, and that just goes a long way. For me some of the biggest skills I've gained aren't the most obvious ones. Sure there's lots of technical math knowledge I learn in my classes, but the biggest one is working together with a team, how can you work together to achieve a common goal. One of my major achievements so far was launching iPhone game with my friend Liam McLaughlin. It's called Smog Game and teaches kids about saving the environment. We even created own company and talked to Apple reps and PwC and Epic and it was really cool just to go from this very small idea to actually have a finished product. I think the future of computer science and game development is heavily leaning towards tech such as AR and VR, but the thing I think people overlook the most is the democratisation of game development and app development. Anyone can get started now, tools are becoming cheaper or free, and just as a bedroom coder make your dream idea into reality, really."
Writing an Abstract in a Computer Science Paper [Communication],0h8woOdNSN4,CS,"We've been talking about writing, and we've been talking about pretty big picture ideas and nuts and bolts stuff, but let's talk about some of the important building blocks of an academic paper, particularly writing the abstract and introduction. I want to specifically emphasize this because the abstract is often the first thing that people see of your paper, and sometimes it's the only thing that people see. Because they read the abstract, they're bidding for papers that they're going to review, or they're just deciding whether this paper is relevant or not. This is kind of the make or break point to make sure that during paper review, you get the right reviewers and later, whether people actually read and eventually cite and use your paper ideas. Building some ideas again from Derek Dreyer ... He proposes a CGI model of writing an abstract CGI stands for context, gap and innovation. So first, what is the context? What are you writing about? And so let's say that we're trying to write an abstract for everything that we're talking about in the series of vignettes. The context writing is important. Despite the importance, it's hard to do it well. There are lots of people who don't know how to do it well. And so we're going to talk about how to become a better writer. The innovation is the part where you sell the paper. The context and the gap are where you position your paper within your field. Another problem that I see is that oftentimes the introduction just repeats the abstract, but the introduction is different from the abstract. The abstract needs to attract the right reviewers. But the introduction is where once you have reviewers, you need to start them on the intellectual journey to understanding and appreciating your idea. It needs to build interest in the non target audience, and it should have specific examples that help explain why your idea is important, why it makes sense , and why it's reasonable. You don't have space to do this in the abstract. The abstract is pretty abstract. The introduction can and should be much more concrete and motivating example is usually a good idea in the introduction. If you can figure out how to do that, then it explains a logical structure of the paper. We'll talk about how to do that well in a bit. The introduction also can connect the paper more broadly. The abstract has the context. It's just one sentence. The introduction can connect ideas in other fields. Contrast with other work. You can do that much more explicitly than in the abstract. This is just a single lecture from a course. YouTube likes to show you these videos out of order, but if you go to the course web page linked below, you can see the lectures in the right order and you can get resources like home works or suggested reading. You can also visit QANTA dot org if you want to learn about our systems for creating computers that can answer questions. Where QANTA stands for question, answering is not a trivial activity.

Games Day at the University of Bristol: Computer Science,G-1rMVOW2B0,CS,"Every year Games Day is the day when a whole year of effort comes together Where teams present their games - first of all to academics here in Computer Science but also to the wider public and to other people from the university. This year we have 11 games they really cover the full range. From games for a single person to games where you have dozens and dozens of people playing each other To create a game you have to start from the bottom up. Think about what people  people would want, what you would enjoy in a game and something that hasn't been done before Which is what we were trying to go for. We've done a lot of CS work throughout past three years this was much more than just CS. We work with composors, we work with artists we learn to manage big teams. We've had like 2,400 hours of effort in total in this game. It feels like being a real company even though you still at Uni. It's very different because it's a very creative project, normally you have a very specific target you have to do. This project you have to combine all your different skills so you need creativity and you need problem-solving and teamwork as well as a combination of all the different things you've learned on the course. How to go about structuring and designing a really large project. How to interact and work with people particularly in software development so interacting the team members the necessities when it comes to managing a project making sure the project goes well. Our composor does the film and TV course here at Bristol he specializes in ambient music I think it's excellent and it really adds a lot to our game Making sure everything was integrated properly, making sure everything worked together. We've got five separate screens three servers making sure that everything work together and making sure if one bit did break then the rest didn't crash entirely as well. We found that the game engines weren't giving us enough control so we developed everything from scratch, from the ground up. Something like 13,000 lines of code and many many hours of work. Every group has different areas of expertise and things that they're specialized in throughout the day. Ours in particular is our AI which we've implemented using a neural network. It's a real opportunity for other developers to come and see the different kind of modern technologies that the new programmers of tomorrow are using We have a murder mystery game. The idea is that it's played on Android phones using Google cardboard only one person will be the murderer and all you have to try and figure out who the murderer is. I'd say it's completely different to anything we've done before. There's structure to it but it's not like, ""do this here, do this then, and this then"". You kind of organise the whole thing yourselves and has a team you have to get behind it so it's much more like a real world application. Having led the team as well as seen the challenges and struggles I think it really builds you as a person, really teaches you skills which are really transferable. This is actually one of the reasons I picked Bristol because they have the games project, other Unis don't. It's really nice to see what is actually achievable by uni students in the space of a year. It's definitely really fun atmosphere on the day as well Building a game in its own right is an immense opportunity to produce something which will carry you possibly further than a specific lecture series could So it's an experience for students that they can take out of their studies for... well, years to come"

Crew: It's not ""just like"". I like, the opposite. [Laughter] I feel like I'm a stop sign. Interfacing with early peripherals was very low level. Requiring programmers to know intimate-- It sounds a bit weird. I feel like I'm playing bagpipes. [Laughter] [Imitating bagpipe sounds] Ekka and his friend-- No. They probably weren't mates. [Laughter] These would wait for the right spot to rotate underneath them to read or write a bit of data to keep this delay as fast as possible. To keep track of what a file is and what's a directory. Just give up there. Non-volatile, solid state drives. Or SS-- No one calls them SSD's. Crew: I call them SSD's. Really? Crew: Yeah! Or SSD's as the cool kids say. Or just Brandon. Crew: Hey! Luckly, newer versions of Windows have better protections and usually don't crash quite that often. [Laughter] And that's a wrap on that video."
Stephen Guy - Computer Science Faculty,k20wB-6Link,CS,"My name is Stephen Guy, and I'm an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering . So the first time I remember seeing something and thinking that was computer science was actually in grade school. I saw a book in on my school's library that said ""kojo and video games"" and I'm like oh that's kind of interesting. I've played video games before but I never thought of trying to create your own anything on a computer. If I can make my own that would be even better to be whatever video game I wanted it to be. Okay, turns out it's not quite that easy. You can't just think of something and make it happen you have to learn how to code, learn how to structure your code well, learn how to come up with your idea and make it fast make it efficient.  It's kind of led to where I am today being at the you researching at the computer science department and I really enjoyed being a computer scientist. I'm glad I ran into that book some of the years ago. So my research is a little bit eclectic think the main theme is kind of artificial intelligence, and what that means to me is I'm trying to work on having computer algorithms that can act either as smart as humans or as social as humans. We use some of the same technology in robotics. As robots becoming more and more common, they're interacting with people more frequently and we want to know if we can understand how people interact what social cues, I mean how people look at each other, smile with each other, indicate which way they're going with their bodies, if robots can learn those same cues they can do a better and better job of being seamless in the environment and doing things around us without getting in the way. I teach a couple different classes in the computer science department so I teach Introduction to Programming Concepts at CScI 1133 and the kind of focus of that class is learning just the basics of coding. One of the basics of programming if you only take that one course you're going to come away knowing how to program you're going to come away very empowered that you can solve problems on your own using Python or C++, whatever the language that you take it in, and you're also going to be exposed to really broad range of what you do in computer science. I think there's lots of reasons to choose computer science. The most obvious one is there's a lot of very practical skills that can take you to many different jobs.  If you look at the alumni from our department there's really so many different things that happen to them. A very common one is to go to the west coast work in a major tech firm places like Facebook, Google, Amazon. Students work in medical device visualizations, database, back-end, software development, web development. Literally a very wide variety of tech related jobs. I think the CLA option for computer science is really a great opportunity for lots of different students. There's so many people that have a passion on top of computing and computer science can really enable them to do more with it. Computer science is a little bit unique and how well it meshes in with lots of different fields. If you're interested in biology there's a role for CS+ biology for doing data analysis for CS+ lots of different fields, and I think from that point of view it really attracts a kind of broad diversity of people with a lot of different interests. It's really exciting when somebody can bring some outside knowledge into the computer science field and use that expertise they have, use those interest they have to do new different things with programming with computer science. I think computer science is a really fun major i would encourage everybody to at least try it, think about taking one course and seeing you know it might be for you, it might be something you really like, and you know take the plunge, take a course, do some computer science and see if you like it. I suspect a lot more people out there would be great computer scientists and would really have a lot of fun as they tried it."
Computer Science Graduate Student Shares,xL_V6kTLuak,CS,"I masters and computer applications and I was  working in the field for last 20 plus years,   in the field of computers, it's not  enough something is missing in my field,   at least the field is going really far. And I'm  lacking some skills I thought let me pursue my   second masters here at Rowan so that I can up with  what I've learned before. This particular course   which I took at Rowan has all the three. It has  a good data analytics, it has machine learning,   it has robotics so they taught me all the stuff.  In fact i'm glad like I took this course the   reason being it covered the six semesters I  had took, it covered everything from me what   I was looking for. I work for Comcast so there we  have we can use all these skills. Comcast is one   of those technology companies where they have all  this scary stuff going on they have a lot a lot of   data they're sitting on billions of data. So this  data analytics course really helps me to use make   use of them and come up with something useful  for the company so this is really like a right   fit this course is an exact fit for my needs. In  undergrad you have a lot of courses 120 credits   you'll have like communication skills this  and that. This is all like just 30 credits   just exactly what you're looking for.  So it's like made for your future. you"
Computer Science Distilled - Book Review,aUVe69tYpWE,CS,"Ok, got a new package. and it's the Computer Science Distilled book. and this will teach you about coding and compitional problem solving. o no actual code but just... Oh might be code actually but the how the different algorithms work. at first glance... Looks nice. Ok so now I've read the book and here is my quick review of Computer Sciende Distilled. Let's begin with the good part(s). It has funny images and teaches the reader a few words to search for to dig deeper. Now the not so good parts: Those images is available online, xkcd.com for the most of them, check it out as it’s usually really funny but they don’t go well with the emoticons the author uses, never seen a book with those before and I hope never to see one again, unless it is a book about them. The book contains summarized bits and pieces of information about different topics related to the subject at hand so unless you actually want to learn about them which you can do from hundreds of different resources this book might be for you. The book is for beginners or those not really involved in computer science and the author does an ok job to but the explain but the examples are usually on a higher level than the basics and can require a bit of mathematical language. Pick up any book on programming or computational thinking and you have what this book offers and more as this only scratches the surface. I fail to understand what the target audience is here as it isn’t for programmers or students nor is it for your mom trying to relate what the hell it is you do between 9gaging and painting your nails. For the price of 19$ for the e-book and 39$ for the hard cover this is not a book I can recommend to my students."
How Does Newcastle University Prepare Students For Working In The Computer Science Industry?,7qLbZ7iC-HA,CS,"So my name's Nick Bedford and I work for Rockstar North I found my experience on the course invaluable for getting a job so there was many aspects of my course which just permeated through my professional career such as the graphics module and physics I've had to deal with that a lot now and without it I don't think I could've got the job My placement was at Intel I was in the IOTG Group so ""Internet of Things Group"" I was in the visual retail team and I was a technical sales specialist I was making different types of software programming, coding and also I was talking to really big clients So one of my biggest jobs was I was managing an event in intergrated systems Europe so this meant I had to travel for a week to Amsterdam You know we've had a lot of success with the students we've had internships we've just hired our latest employees out of Newcastle University My placement was at PWC it was an intership that lasted about 11 months compared to everyone else's it was really good we did two rotations so I worked in the innovation team for six months and I also did one programming doing full-step programming that was really fun You definitely need to be open I didn't think I'd end up working for an accountancy firm to be honest I'm more of a creative person but you become more open to it in the process you get rejections, you learn from it and eventually I actually found a placement that was really valuable and I think you just have to remember that even if you do a tech degree you don't have to work for a tech company neccessarily So with having been on placement and having tight deadlines and clients and your team actually relying on you to do a piece of work you actually have to do it by that time if not earlier So I was invited here at the School of Computing to speak to students who are thinking about placements as part of their study they've got excellent opportunities to learn about the 'soft-skills' side as well as the more technical elements of their course and the University is helping those skills being brought together to make them more employable when it comes to opportunities in the future that they're going to applying for Being able to feed into what students are taught and what we need as an industry and when we get students from the course they're all ready to go to crack on we're an indie studio, we need to we need to move on things quickly so that's perfect for us I had my first interview and I got my first job because I obviously had the experience compared to everyone else so even though I did a lot of society stuff I think it's really important to do placement because otherwise you don't have the skills you need to work in the workplace As a university I think it's just so approachable and such a nice student city that I would definitley recommend it"

A spirited teacher reshapes the computer science classroom for 21st-century makers,YaxjWSotoZo,CS,"Are you a robot? Beep. Not the same way as you are, but yes I am. I came in, saw people working on it and I was like “Ohhhh!” And then I was like “Gotta do this.” There was a point where computer science was only for a certain type of person, you know a very engineering-oriented,  high-level kind of a person. As technology became more prevalent in our society and more people noticed it and understood what it was, different types of people started to enter into it. I used to think I wanted to be an English major, which has definitely changed but in the same sense it hasn’t. It’s still creating, and it’s still like a language in itself. I just finished a game where I mixed space fighting with balancing chemical equations. I think it’s a way to take ideas in your mind, your imagination, and bring them to life on a device of some kind in front of you. The app that I made was for people with ADD since I myself have ADD, I tend to not be able to sit still, so I created an app to just give somebody something to do with their hands. I think computer science today really is for the kid who is great at business or biology or history or whatever subject they may love but they have this other skill set or way of thinking called computer science that helps them solve the problems of that specific industry. I think there’s opportunity for everybody even if you’re not necessarily a code nerd. Computer science is something amazing. It’s all about expressing yourself. Almost like a cold, couldn’t get rid of it There’s just really no limit to what you can do."
Graduate Student Research: Computer Science at GW,2wEi4VGE3sQ,CS,"This lab that you're looking at is MOCA - the Motion Capture and Analysis Lab. We're in the process of building a system which captures three-dimensional surfaces, primarily of humans, moving. It has a variety of different uses. We are interested in applications of computer graphics, primarily for medical applications. We are in the process of building a simulator for performing endotracheal intubation for neo nates, which is a very difficult procedure because a child is so small. Just like flight simulators are used to train pilots, we are making these simulators that train physicians to perform especially difficult procedures. I designed the whole system and provided the solutions for particular problems, and also figured out the research direction. Computer graphics is a cross-discipline subject that involves knowledge from mathematics, physics, optics, and engineering. We use multiple Kinects to capture the close-range depth image of the human body. We take probably eight phases and we set an angle of the meshes. We build up a 3D human body using non-rigid registration Whenever I make the algorithm work, I can see it vividly on the screen and that is something that makes me feel good about it. You want to have passion for what you do, so find something that you're passionate about and especially if you're interested in coming to GW, I would suggest that you contact a professor who is interested in a field that's similar in the area that you have interest in. Talk to them, and make these personal connections. So in the Cloud Systems Research Lab here at GW, we're focusing on very large-scale computer systems. When we talk about the cloud, we really mean hundreds of thousands or even millions of computers that are spread around the world, but that together form some big applications. Our research group is looking at ways to manage these systems to make them more efficient, make them more reliable, and provide them better security than they would have otherwise. We have a cluster of about 50 computers here, and we use these to develop new software infrastructures to manage these types of computer clusters. In our projects, we build it on a hypervisor and we are trying to look inside into the guest virtual machines of memory or hard disk to detect potential attacks. Once we detect those attacks, we can prevent the attack from happening. We are trying to protect operating systems running inside operating systems on virtualization and computers. If you really want to work with us and faculty, this is a really good place to come to and study."
Day in the Life of a Transfer Student | Computer Science,H8zGAosHorQ,CS,"Hi, my name is Tabitha Miles, and I’m a current senior at Simmons.  I’m majoring in computer science. A typical day for me during volleyball  season starts at 5:30 in the morning.  I get up and I get dressed for practice.  I have practice until 8:45am and  then I head straight to class. I think my favorite part about computer science is the fact that you can just create so much.  There’s quite literally an  infinite amount of things  you can create with code and with programming. But, more specifically,   I’ve been really interested in the education of computer science. After class, I eat breakfast on  campus at one of the dining halls.  When I get back to my room, I take my dog outside and feed her.  Her name is Coconut,  and she is a chihuahua weiner dog, and she’s my emotional support animal. Most of my classes are in  the mornings and end by noon,  so I usually have the rest of  the day to do other things. When I transferred to Simmons during  the first year of the pandemic,  I was very nervous about going to a new school  across the country and  leaving my home in California.  Many people close to me warned  me that it might be too risky,  but it ended up being the best  decision I have ever made. One of the main reasons why I  transferred was the smaller class sizes,  and because I really wanted all  my professors to know me by name. I am on the volleyball team, am on the board of a club,  and I’m a resident advisor. Every one of these experiences   has really helped me grow my roots  here in the Simmons community I have one last semester here at Simmons, and I’m still working on what comes next.  I’m grateful for the opportunity Simmons  and the local community have provided me,  and also that I took a chance and transferred."

Business Information Systems Easier Than Computer Science?,217HmXheGkk,CS,"Have you ever asked yourself: If business information systems are easier than computer  science? And if you ever had this question,  I would like to ask this question for you   NO! To answer this question for you, because  I think this is a really great question,   which definitely needs some recognition because i'm going to tell you from my own experience,   why I decided for business information systems  instead of for computer science, and I want to help   you also have to make the right decision. So if you're not sure, and if you don't have the confidence   to make the right decision, you always have to look at two things about yourself. So the first   thing is to ask yourself who I am. And the second  thing is what kind of experience or let's say,   what kind of resources do I have? I  have, for example, a medical background,   which means that during the years, when I worked in the hospital, when I have to wake up every   morning, or let's say every second day around 3:00 AM in the morning to start my work at  5:30 AM in the morning, of course.  So during those years,  I have gained,   let's say some kind of discipline, which is  also really important during your studies.   And the other thing is that even when I  had like a full-time job, I also started my own,   let's say, small web design company. And I also know how to keep up the discipline to teach yourself   programming languages, which is of course,  and the first step really, really difficult,   but over a week, months, or maybe years,  it becomes even easier. And then   of course, you're going to laugh about them. From my own experience.   I'm quite comfortable with mathematics, which is also really important for computer science,   but also for business information systems. But you have to understand that the courses   of mathematics in computer science are more difficult than in business information systems.   And if you have difficulties, especially in  mathematics, then I wouldn't recommend you   to study computer science because chances that you fail are pretty high, but it doesn't mean   that you cant pass computer science. And to answer a question, if business information systems   is easier than computer science? From my own point of view, I have to tell you that computer   science is definitely more difficult. I would definitely recommend you to compare both schedules with each other. I mean, the schedules of computer science and the schedules of business information systems and take a close look at the courses to get some    Kind of feeling what kind of courses you might have to face. And if those courses,   fulfill your expectations, you have  about the study and maybe adjust a little bit,   listen to your own heart. And maybe make a good decision at the end of the day. Because    you're going to save a lot of time. You're going to save a lot of frustration during your studies.   And if you don't know, if you don't really  know why you study something, it's going to be   definitely hard for you to pass the study.  And if my video has helped you a little bit,   and you say: Hey, I liked the video.  Definitely. I would like to commend you to   like this video and also to subscribe this  channel to support a little bit. And I just want   to say at the end of the video: Thank you very much. We're going to see each other in the next video. Peace!"
Georgia Tech - Skype Interview with Online Computer Science Graduate Student,ax9ybaxbmv8,CS,"My first question to you, Christina, is you're all the way in Minnesota, so what prompted you to enroll in Georgia Tech's online Master of Science in Computer Science program? I've been a developer for 10 years, but I have no formal training in any aspect of that. I actually have a Master's in Chemical Engineering from University of Illinois a long time ago. And, um, the way careers do, mine sort of took a left turn at one point and I found myself doing development, uh, sort of without the degree to back it up. I had thought about grad school previously but I have a more than full time job and three kids and I volunteer in the community, so there's no way that—Even driving time would make, uh, something like that impossible. So, when I heard about the online program, and given the, the low cost and the convenience, I just thought I'm kind of, this is an opportunity that's too good to pass up. I want, uh, to get an idea as to what a typical week would be like for you. Uh, things are pretty crazy for me right now, uh, in terms of work. You know, over the course of the semester, there's enough flexibility that things can ebb and flow a little bit. Hopefully work will calm down for me pretty soon and I can start doing homework before midnight What would you say has been the best part of this online experience for you, or the program overall? The first class that I took, uh, last semester was Machine Learning. Uh, which, I found out after the fact, is probably the toughest course that the program offers. At the same time, when I finished the semester, I had a real sense of accomplishment in terms of, you know, if I could conquer that class, I can—I know I can cut it in the program. When you go off and do some research, which we had to do for a couple of papers. You know, your own experimental type research that you learn at a level that, you know, is not really possible in any other venue. In your opinion, how would you say that this online program has changed the realm of higher education overall? How has it influenced it, you think? Until now, the model is, sort of, you've got a certain number of spots, and then you look at who applies, and then you pick the right people for those spots and everybody else is kind of out of luck. And this, the essential model change, I think, there is if you can do the work, then you can participate, which is a profound difference. From a student standpoint, it's also a difference in terms of, you know, it isn't just a matter of, ""Do you live close enough to someplace that would offer something appropriate and do you have the buckets of cash that it would take to, you know, dump into something like this. I've got three kids headed for college, so there's no way an expensive program would be in the cards for me. You know, and so, it sort of changes the model in terms of reducing some of those barriers. I think barriers that everyone kind of assumed were fixed are starting to fall, which is exciting."
Counting in Computer Science,LA3R7Tk-8LY,CS,"We just saw three interesting examples; paper folding, Rubik's cube and the friends taking photos example. If you are wondering what has this to do with computing, here goes the answer. It is indeed important for us to understand when will my piece of program stop. It might go on forever what if you are trying to enumerate all possible permutations of 1, 2, 3, up to 20, this is same as 20 people taking all possible pictures. If you were to enumerate all these things on your computer you will not be able to do it for a simple reason that it's a huge number of possibilities. So all we are trying to say is it is very, very, very important for us to have an idea as to how many steps will your computer take in order to execute a task. For that we need to understand counting at a very different level. And this chapter is all about understanding how to count in a situation where it is not just about 1, 2, 3, 4, it's about enumerated all the objects in a system."
Meet a Computer Science Graduate Student: Olivia Keohane,0kEfGw40GDM,CS,"Hi, my name is Olivia Keohane and I'm a computer science graduate student The thing I love about computer science is that there are so many different areas you can go into and one in particular I'm interested in is data science. I think computer science is the way the world is heading Last semester I started research with Dr. Aizenberg on image filtering and we are continuing on with that research for my master thesis Image filtering is something that is used in a variety of fields For example: the medical industry, forensics, satellite pictures. It's a more efficient manner of getting clear images and will lead to better results in whichever industry it's working in. My advice to anyone who is considering being a computer science major here at Manhattan would be to not be afraid to reach out, whether it's to professors, to peers, to any administrative offices. Anything you need help with. Join as many clubs as you can, especially related to your major because it will help advance you. It will prepare you better. I love being in New York City because it provides you with so many things to do. Like, you are never bored here. On top of that, the professional advantages it provides is also a plus because of so many job opportunities in the city, no matter what industry you're in. You will have no problem finding a job. I've built a lot of independence here where I am ready to go off into a professional field and ready to work. Being involved in so many different things leads you to so many different people, and so many different conversations and ideas and point of views and you can talk about things that you're interested in with other people whom are interested in the same thing. It's nice because you do get to build those strong relationships I've always wanted a school with a community feeling and Manhattan College really does have that through the small classroom sizes, small department sizes, everything."

CS,CMeeALvT58A,CS,"Computer science focuses on the programming of the computer So you're telling the computer ""these are the steps you're going to do to achieve this end result."" Computer science is a very energetic and fast-growing area. With a computer science degree, the options are unlimited because every place you go, you will see the applications of computing. We actually have a lot of people working for companies like Amazon HP, Tyson. They not only will come in and talk to us about their jobs But they'll also come in and recruit. I interned with Walmart this past summer and I got a full-time offer. So I plan to go there after college. We try out best to help the students and one-on-one is one of the advantages the students have the care the professsors take to make sure that the full spectrum is taught to not just the advanced students, but also the students who come in never having programmed before but thinking, ""hey this is something I might be interested in."" It's hard. It's a challenge, but you learn so much. Being able to learn and solve problems I think that's the most important thing. Technology changes so fast You have to be able to adapt and learn quickly. There's always professors you can always email them and be like ""I really need help on this problem; I really don't understand."" and they'll make an appointment with you and you can come in and just ask all the questions that you'd like. No matter what you decide to do with a computer science degree afterwards, having that knowledge of how a computer works will greatly, vastly improve your ability to do whatever it is you want to do."
UMBC Master of Arts in Education - Computer Science,BhmViRFcsDQ,CS,"Hello there and welcome to MAE in computer science that is master of Education and computer science program. This is what some of our cohorts are saying about this program. Miss Lizama is saying that MAE computer science has helped me become aware of my practices as a teacher to bring equitable and culturally sensitive practices to the classroom. It has built a small family of caring teachers invested in advancement of students in computer science. Mr. Marshall is saying it's a great opportunity to learn computer science, principles, programing and pedagogy. While Ms. Manly is saying, I'm new this semester, but I can say this program is so needed and it's a good program to help close that gap of having computer science in all schools. While Ms. Spark - This small class has made the discussion meaningful and intimate that we have a trust and a bond. Now, while Ms. Cooper says I'm currently in my third course of the MAE Computer Science Program in CSED 527 Culturally Responsive Instruction in computer science. I feel like my capacity to promote equitable and excellence for all students in science education has been deepened and enhanced in the programing courses. Not only am I learning programing, but pedagogical approaches to the content that is applicable to my role as a high school science teacher and our program. I can tell you a little bit about me. You can read all about it there and you can ask me questions later at the benefit. As I have said before, this program is that no GRE, no math requirement. All you need to be is a certified teacher,  is a flat Twelve thousand dollars for everybody else. And we prepare you very well. And like you had from our cohort, we are very, very sensitive about cultural responsive instruction and equity in computer science education. We are focused on that. Our program does go from K to twelve. These are the courses for six to twelve. That is for secondary teachers. So you would make a choice of six from here. And if you are in elementary, if you elementary, that's K through five, this will be the choices of the courses that you would take over here again. You would choose six of them. We also currently right now offering a non degree program and you can choose three from here or choose as many as you want as a non degree program student if you want, because we would provide it for you. But hopefully once you get into that, you'd want to finish the program. And if you ever wanted to meet me in person, that will be at the Sherman Building second floor. I'm usually not there since all our programs are online. One hundred percent synchronized and synchronized. So always send me an email at dkariuki@umbc.edu. If you need any support with anything that is not content related, you may contact Rita Williams She'll help you with your registration, with the administration, with your may be card so that you don't have to pay for for your registration or any of those other things that you need. Ms. Rita Williams will help you. And that's her email over there. That's just a quick glimpse of what this program does. So please come see us at our open houses so you can get more information about this program. Thank you very much."
Studying Computer Science at Adelaide,nAl2pN5UMx4,CS,"I chose Computer Science because I was always interested in technology, I was always really good with computers, even from a young age, and it just seemed natural to me. My family got their first, our first computer at 3,  and I spent so much time on there, and I probably trashed the thing, but you know I picked up a lot. I've never been a hardware guy.  It was all the software. Just lots and lots of fiddling around and doing stuff. I picked Software Engineering at Adelaide because, Adelaide is just nice and centrally located, So I could do things around the city as well and also because, the actual course at Adelaide was more compelling than the competing courses. My favourite subject is a subject called,  It's a subject where we try and show the world there are different problems in society,  and we hope to solve them using different parts of technology. My favorite subject that I've done so far would have been my Honours degree I think,  because it sorted, gave me a taste of what real work is like, and I got to work in a team of really great people,  really smart people, and I got to produce something tangible, that I thought was awesome.  And it was just really fulfilling to finish that project. Computer Science lecturers are fantastic as well, I haven't come across anyone who I really dislike there,  they're knowledgable but also they're willing to share their knowledge, and they make it easy. At uni, in terms of work placements, there's 6 week placements you can do over the summer holidays,  and also a lot of companies in Adelaide also offer 3-month-long internships.  So I did a 3-month-placement for the public service, on defence matters.  It was really good. I got to work with really smart people, I got to work with people who had come through uni, come through the exact same pathways I did, and see how they transitioned to work life. It was really fun and I learnt a lot, so it was great.  So if you want to go into this degree from high school, you definitely have to do maths studies, you don't have to a specialist maths because that's not a prerequisite and you can catch that up here. but at a minimum, you should do maths studies. Actually I've already got a job offer, so next year moving to Seattle to work for Microsoft, up in their big campus there I guess. I'm hoping to get into the entertainment industry, video games. I also do a lot of music, so I will try to incorporate music into all of that as well. and I'd love to travel. You think maybe that you are interested in things that are just obscure, but at uni, there'll be someone who is interested in the same things you are,  there'll be people that you can get along with, no matter what you're like.  I've learnt that I really love doing what I'm doing I love being at uni, I love studying, but I also love programming and I love software engineering,  I love the social environment here at uni, and I love talking to people,  like-minded people, people that are intelligent and dedicated to what they do.

Welcome to Engineering@Vanderbilt M.S. in Computer Science,1pizuwArjB4,CS,"[music playing] Hi. I'm Dr. Jules White. I'm the director of the online Master's degree program in computer science at Vanderbilt University. As computer scientists, the things that we work with on a daily basis are continuously changing. The software, the programming languages, the tools are all in flux. And not only that, the rate that they're changing is only increasing. This program is designed to give you the principles of computer science and are what you need to build and evolve as the domain changes. The world class faculty are conducting research looking 5, 10, and 20 years into the future to identify the key problems in computer science and develop solutions to them. But they're also using this knowledge from research to inform the design of their classes to make sure that you're taught the right principles and techniques to be successful as these changes and new problems are solved. The faculty members are also entrepreneurs and innovators. The faculty members have created companies and domains ranging from model-driven engineering to cybersecurity to augmented reality. But the faculty also understand how you take research ideas and transition them into fantastic and groundbreaking software. Open source software created by the faculty members has been used in everything from rockets to mobile apps to German beer bottling. At the same time, they've taken this knowledge, and they've applied it to create engaging, hands-on programming and other assignments that you'll use to test your knowledge of these principles and also to develop your understanding of the material. Along the way, you'll develop a portfolio of work that will showcase your abilities and be invaluable when you go and apply for jobs. On behalf of the Vanderbilt University community, the Department of Computer Science, and myself, I welcome you to the program. And I look forward to working with you. [music playing]"
What is Biology?,6v8djXa-IPQ,BIO,"What is Biology? You may have learned to classify a rose or a human as living, rock and water as non-living. But why is this so? If you say that ""living"" is something that moves, but then flowing water can be called ""living"". Right? That's not entirely true. Life has a set of properties that an organism has to follow to be called ""living"". And a wonderful discipline of science studies life in great detail. It is called Biology. The word ""Bio"" means living, and ""logy"" means study. So Biology means the study of living things. Simply put: Anything which interacts with its environment, use energy and reproduce are known as living things. For example, we, humans, eat food to get energy, feel and respond to our environment, and reproduce to make more of ourselves. Many other living things like insects, birds, and animals have the same properties like us. So, they are all living organisms. Now the question arises how many types of living things are there? And how are they different from us? Biology is a field which answers these questions and many more questions related to living things. What is Biology? There are 7 characteristics that a living thing follows and therefore we study these in the vast field of biology. These are: One: Order If you examine a rose from near, you will notice it is very ordered. The petals are folded around each other with the center-bearing seeds. This illustrates the highly ordered structure that typifies life. Living cells are the basis of this complex organization. Two: Reproduction Organisms reproduce their own kind. A mother giant panda will always give birth to a panda, not a horse. We learned that from Kungfu Panda, too. Three: Growth and Development Inherited information in the form of DNA controls the pattern of growth and development of all organisms. You most probably look like your parents or close relative, thanks to the genes. Four: Energy Processing We, humans, eat food to get energy. The food we eat has also eaten some food to utilize its chemical energy stored in order to power its own activities and chemical reactions. Five: Responds to the environment All organisms respond to environmental stimuli. This is why you laugh when you're tickled. Six: Regulation Many types of mechanisms regulate an organism's internal environment. Keeping it within limits that sustain life. This is also called homeostasis. A lemur sunbathes to help raise the animal's body temperature on cold mornings. Seven: Evolutionary Adaptation Lions use camouflage to blend in with the savanna so they can easily hunt down an animal. Such adaptations evolve over many generations. Some new concepts like genes and DNA are introduced in this video. These will be explained in our upcoming videos. Stay tuned!"

Biology: Cell Transport,ufCiGz75DAk,BIO,"Cell transport is the process of how things move in or out of the cell through the cell membrane There are two broad categories of cell Transport The first Category is passive transport, for a cell passive transport means It's an automatic process that doesn't require any input of energy for example Diffusion is a passive process in which particles move either into or out of the cell from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration The cell doesn't use any energy when this happens The second Category of cell Transport is active Transport This is when particles move from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration when particles move against the concentration gradient Energy is required often to allow protein pumps to assist in Particle Movement why would the cell need to move particles from a low to high concentration and expend energy to do it An Important example is seen in your heart muscle cells In order for your heart to beat there are certain molecules that have to move from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration for those cardiac muscle cells to work So the main things to remember are passive transport happens automatically with no energy required while active transport needs energy for it to occur  "
Studying Biological Sciences,BtdqqX-zYnc,BIO,"Biological Sciences at Bangor University starts really broad in the first year bringing everybody to the same level of knowledge so we look at things like diversity of the organisms and genetics and bioscience skills. In the second year we get to choose our own modules because we already know what we're interested in and we're introduced to more complex concepts of the area. And the third year we use the knowledge from the first and the second year to work on our dissertation projects. What I love the most about Biological Sciences is that it always changes so there are always new topics coming up or a new species discovered so you never get bored being a scientist really. At Bangor we have many facilities for studying biological sciences, we have Brambell building where we have laboratories to do practicals such as dissections and microbiology experiments. We have the Natural History Museum which all the students have access to and also an aquarium and also we have the main library for scientific books As part of biological sciences we can do a field trip module and we can go to places like South Africa or India or Arizona and study the species from the area. We also get the chance to do the local field trips where we study the environments around Bangor. At Bangor we have many lecturers who are specialised in in different areas of biology and I really like in the lectures when they talk about their own studies and research, I find that really inspiring. When I graduate I would like to go into the research work the university helps me with career advice and CV building workshops. I want to do research because the lectures really inspired me to do so. I am really enjoying my studies at Bangor so I would advise anyone who wants to become a scientist to come here. you"
What is Homeostasis? | Physiology | Biology | FuseSchool,quQr6X1Q58I,BIO,"So what is homeostasis? Homeostasis is a term first defined by Claude Bernard in 1865. It means maintaining a constant internal environment. Wow, great, that really explains it doesn't it. Let me try and make it a bit clearer then. Imagine the cockpit of a plane, it is packed full of dials, And it is the pilot's job to make sure they all stay in the right place. If any of them change she will correct the plane to keep them in the right place and the plane in the air. This is a bit like how our brain works. Sensors all around the body are measuring various things and sending the information back to the brain. The brain then does its best to keep all these things stable and constant to keep the body working properly. This is homeostasis maintaining a constant internal environment. So what kind of things needs to be kept constant in the body? Well, it's very important to keep our temperature the same at around 37 degrees Celsius. You can find out more about this in the video on temperature regulation. You also need to keep the levels of sugar in the blood constant along with levels of ions and water. Your blood pressure needs to be carefully monitored along with the amounts of waste in the blood such as carbon dioxide and urea. Okay, so let's say one of these factors goes too high or low. What is the brain going to do to get it back to the normal levels? The answer to that is negative feedback. Negative feedback is the process where the brain uses either hormone or nervous system to send a signal to the part of the body that can rectify the problem. For example, after you eat a meal your blood sugar level increases You can see it on this graph. This is detected and the pancreas will release a hormone called insulin that causes the sugar to be stored in the liver. Therefore, as you can see on the graph, the blood sugar level returns to normal. Negative feedback is the loop from which the body detects the stimulus, reacts by responding accordingly, and brings the body back to the normal levels. So why is homeostasis so important? Our metabolism, which is all the chemical reactions in our bodies that keep us alive, is controlled by enzymes. These enzymes only work in very specific conditions. If these conditions change, they could stop working and we could die. Luckily all this happens without you having to think about it. If you had to do it yourself you would spend all day and night just trying to keep all these things constant. And would have no time to do anything fun like watch videos of cats on the internet."
WELL THIS IS AWKWARD: Matt Walsh has to educate biology student on biology,mB573AmATKw,BIO,"Student: Hi. I thought you had some really good points, but I just wanted to ask you about hybrids and stuff because I'm here studying biology, and so we've learned a lot about genetic mutations, and disorders, and such, and there actually are hermaphrodite humans beings, where they have both ovaries and testicles. And that... I have it right here. It's actually a medical condition called ""ovotesticular disorder."" And there are also other genetic disorders where people are born with XXY, just X, or just Y, and such. And while it may seem rare, there are hundreds of thousands of people born with this each year. And so, going off of your fairytale hybrid people, they do exist, and I'm just wondering how that would play into your view of there being a spectrum of gender because... Walsh: These are people who can get pregnant and also impregnate someone else? Student: Yes. Hermaphrodites have both ovaries and testicles. Walsh: No. No. No. [Audience chattering] Walsh: If such a person existed, I would not include that part in my next speech, but... [Audience laughter] Walsh: ...such a person does not exist. Now, intersex and gender deformities, as you talked about, do exist, and I expected someone to bring that up in the Q and A. I think it's a fine point to bring up. Two things I would say to that. Number one, that actually has nothing to do with transgenderism because if when we're talking about transgender, we're talking specifically about intersex people, then we would just say ""intersex."" But with transgender, most of the time, we're talking about men who don't have any deformities, they are just straight-up men, clearly, and they are identifying as women. So even if I agree that what you're talking about is some sort of exception, that actually would have nothing to do with the transgender topic. But I don't think it is an exception because, as I said, I think a true resident of the middle circle of the Venn diagram would be someone who has the reproductive capabilities of both genders, and no one like that exists. I mean, not to be crude, but there isn't anyone who can get themselves pregnant, right? That doesn't exist in the human kingdom, anyway. So I think what you're talking about there are people who have deformities, and so in their case, it would be more difficult than usual to determine what their actual biological sex is because the usual indicators aren't there or aren't as obvious, but that doesn't mean that they don't have a biological sex. It's just not as clear."
Biologist Career Video,JcAUqJoUgBI,BIO,"From the smallest microorganism to the giant blue whale, every living thing is of interest to biologists, who study the basic principles of plant and animal life. Biologists use the scientific method, testing their ideas or hypotheses through experimentation, to investigate questions about the origin of life, its development, and the relationships between living things, as well as a creature’s anatomy and how it functions in its environment. Whether they’re working in a lab, out in the field, or at a university, biologists collect and analyze biological data, although the specifics of their research are as varied as the creatures in nature. For example, some biologists may work almost exclusively with computer models, while others may spend months collecting and studying specimens at sea. Many specialize in working with plants, animals, or the environment. Biologists need strong communication skills. Their work is often as much about interacting with people and institutions as it is focusing on DNA or anatomy. A career in biology generally requires a bachelor’s degree in the field. Many biologists attend graduate school to earn more advanced research positions or professorships."
Cells - Introduction | Biology | Don&#39;t Memorise,_u3GEXZPDa8,BIO,"We all love reading story books. Every story is framed with sentences, and sentences are framed using words. And what are words made up of? They are made up of letters! If you notice, then everything around us is made up of one or the other smaller entity. These small entities are called Basic units! Did you know, that even our body is made up basic units? Yes it is! Although it appears to be one single body, it is actually made up of millions of basic units coming together! what these units are called? They are known as CELLS! Cells come in different numbers to form our body, rather, any living organism’s body. Can you guess the minimum number of cells required to form an organism’s body? Do you know the answer? There are organisms which are made up of only a single cell! They are called the unicellular organisms! Bacteria are one of the best examples of this category. what are organisms like us called then? We belong to the category of multi-cellular organisms. Those having several cells to make up the body are called multi-cellular organisms Now the next important question is… if there are so many cells in our body, then are all of them exactly the same? Of course NOT! There are many number of cells in our body, and so are their types! Look at these cells for example! These look so different! But astonishingly, all three are a part of our body! This one is an ovum, this is a neuron and the last one is a Red Blood Cell. Their structures, shapes, sizes are totally different from each other, and so are their functions! This is how various types of cells come together in different numbers to form our body. We have this knowledge today! But ever wondered how all this was actually discovered? Let us go back in time, and have a look at the history of cellular studies."

What Is Aerobic Respiration? | Physiology | Biology | FuseSchool,ZkqEno1r2jk,BIO,"Respiration is just breathing right? Wrong! Respiration is the chemical process that supplies the body with energy for all other life processes. Growth and repair of cells, muscle contraction, protein synthesis, sending nerve impulses, absorbing molecules and active transport to name just a few. It happens in all living cells. Not just animal cells but also blood cells. There are two types of respiration: aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Aerobic means with air and so needs oxygen. Whereas anaerobic respiration doesn't need oxygen. Let's start by looking at aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration releases energy in cells by breaking down food substances whilst in the presence of oxygen. It is represented by this simplified equation... But don't forget the energy which is released. Glucose is broken down by oxygen to release the byproducts of carbon dioxide and water. Energy is released which is then used to make a special energy molecule called ATP. ATP is how energy is stored for later use by the body. Aerobic respiration happens all the time in all cells, usually in the mitochondria. Animals get the oxygen needed from the air, through their ventilation systems. Plants get their oxygen from the air through the stomata. Do you remember how photosynthesis works? Compare these two equations... You can hopefully see that aerobic respiration works in the opposite way to photosynthesis. Plants produce food by photosynthesis and then through respiration release energy from it. But don't be confused: whilst plants do release oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis they don't necessarily take in this oxygen for respiration. They just take in any oxygen from the air. Plants respire throughout the day and night as do animals. But they only photosynthesize during the day when there is light available. So this is how aerobic, or with air, respiration works. You just need to remember that glucose is broken down in the presence of oxygen, to release carbon dioxide + water and energy. In the next video we will have a look at anaerobic respiration and how it differs."

The Central Dogma of Biology,9kOGOY7vthk,BIO,"The DNA double helix contains two linear sequences of  the letters A C G and T, which carry coded instructions.  Transcription of DNA begins with a bundle of factors assembling at the start of a gene, to read off the information  that will be needed to make a protein. The blue molecule is unzipping the double helix and copying one of the two strands.  The yellow chain snaking out of the top   is a close chemical cousin of DNA called RNA. The building blocks to make the RNA enter through an intake hole.  They are matched to the DNA - letter by letter - to copy the gene.  At this point the RNA needs to be edited before it can be translated into a protein. This editing process is called splicing, which involves removing the green non-coding regions called ""introns"", leaving only the yellow, protein-coding ""exons."" Splicing begins with assembly of factors at the intron/exon borders,  which act as beacons to guide small proteins to form a splicing machine, called the spliceosome.  The animation is showing this happening in real time. The spliceosome then brings the exons on either side of  the intron very close together, ready to be cut.  One end of the intron is cut and  folded back on itself to join and form a loop. The spliceosome then cuts the RNA to release the loop and  join the two exons together.  The edited RNA and intron are released,  and the spliceosome disassembles. This process is repeated for every intron in the RNA. Numerous spliceosomes remove all the introns so that the edited RNA contains only exons, which are the complete instructions for the protein.  Again, this is happening in real time.  When the RNA copy is complete,  it snakes out into the outer part of the cell. Then all the components of a molecular factory called a ribosome lock together around the RNA. It translates the genetic information in the RNA into a string of amino acids that will become a protein.  Special transfer molecules - the green triangles - bring each amino acid to the ribosome. Inside the ribosome, the RNA is pulled through like a tape. There are different transfer molecules for each of  the twenty amino acids, shown as small red tips.  The code for each amino acid is read off the RNA,  three letters at a time, and matched to three corresponding letters on the transfer molecules.  The amino acid is added to the growing protein chain and after a few seconds the protein starts to emerge from the ribosome. Ribosomes can make many proteins.  It just depends what genetic message you feed into the RNA."

What are the Branches of Biology?,2z8AaRpZ6FI,BIO,"BRANCHES OF BIOLOGY Hey there, I am biology and I have knowledge about all living organisms. And I am mother of twelve children. My first child is Cellular Biology that studies the structure and function of cells. The other one, Molecular Biology, studies the biological processes on a molecular level. Evolutionary Biology solely focuses on biology from an evolutionary point of view to predict how biology will evolve. Bio-engineering builds products by using engineering concepts applied to biological systems. Cardiac stunts are an example of this. Marine Biology is responsible for studying all the creatures that live within the marine environment. Medical Biology studies all fields that are related to illnesses, alterations, and functions of the human body. Mycology studies solely fungi. Zoology is responsible for the study of animal life as a whole. Botany; it deals directly with the study of plants. Microbiology deals with the study of organisms that are invisible to naked eye. Here is Environmental Biology, which deals with the way in which all the living and non-living elements of the environment interact with each other. Last but never the least: this is Astrobiology, the branch of biology concerned with the effects of outer space on living organisms and the search for extra-terrestrial life.

What Is Eutrophication | Agriculture | Biology | FuseSchool,6LAT1gLMPu4,BIO,"Eutrophication is the process that can happen in a water body, like a river or a lake, when too many nutrients are added to the system. Eutrophication starts with fertilizers, which are rich in nutrients like nitrate and phosphate, are washed into the river or lake system. This leads to an increase in nutrient concentrations in the water. The nutrients are food for algae. The algae grow and reproduce quickly, forming a thick green bloom in the water. This algal bloom will absorb sunlight shining on the water so the sunlight can't reach the bottom. Plants who need this light to photosynthesis will die. The algae will also start to die when they eat up all of the nutrients and run out of food. Next, bacteria start to breakdown the dead plants and algae. That releases more nutrients back into the water continuing the Algal Bloom Cycle. The bacteria, with a continuing supply of food, reproduce into much larger numbers consuming oxygen as they grow and respire. There is not much oxygen in the water to begin with so when the bacteria consume it quickly it might run out completely. Water without oxygen is called Anoxic. If the water turns anoxic all non-bacterial life in the water, including fish and other animals, will die. So, eutrophication happens when nutrients are added to water which causes an algal bloom, cutting off sunlight and feeding bacteria. The bacteria use up oxygen in the water which becomes an anoxic, causing everything living in the water to die. Eutrophication is one reason why we need to be carefull with fertilizers when we are growing crops."
introduction to metabolism | Biology basics|,0wkhe0yfCBA,BIO,"Welcome to moomoomath and science. In this video I would like to talk about metabolism. You may have heard that you have a fast metabolism or a slow metabolism. But what exactly is your metabolism? Your metabolism is the sum of all chemical reactions within the cells of living things. Take a look at this summary of all of the chemical reactions taking place in a human. It is a little confusing. The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into pathways in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, with the help of enzymes. An example of a pathway is cellular respiration in which glucose and oxygen are transformed into carbon dioxide water and ATP which is used for energy You can break metabolism down into three main categories. The chemical reactions used for the conversion of food to energy The conversion of food into building blocks used to make other items like proteins The chemical reactions needed for the elimination of waste Enzymes are crucial to metabolism Enzymes help speed up chemical reactions. The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as products. Almost all chemical reactions in the cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life There are over 5000 chemical reactions that occur in plants, animals, and microbes that are controlled by enzymes. Most of the structures that make up animals, plants and microbes are made from three basic classes of molecule: amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. Many chemical reactions focus on making these molecules during the construction of cells and tissues, or by breaking them down and using them as a source of energy during digestion and cellular respiration. These chemicals can also be joined together to make DNA and proteins. So there you go metabolism the sum of chemical reactions that take place in living things.

What is Synthetic Biology?,dfYu-FVgSYE,BIO,"What is it life? What makes it different from just matter? Everything living or not is just chemicals made from atoms. These fish and the water of the fishery in are just soups of atoms but what makes the fish alive and not the water, is how the atoms are organized, by a special kind of molecule and you know this because you learned about it in high school... DNA. The double helix molecule that houses the chemical alphabet of A's and C's and T's and G's. Which in different combinations can make a flower or a frog for you. Every living creature has its code that makes it grow, reproduce and change. DNA turns dust into life and how it does that I will now here's the mystery. 20 years ago scientists learned to read a creature's entire DNA sequence beginning to end a genome it's called they did this for simple things like bacteria, and then for more complex flies, and eventually for humans. And then they began to tinker to take the glow from a jellyfish and transfer it to account to make critters do what they'd never done before. And as biologists got better at this as Stanford professor Drew Endy, a new kind of science was born: ""called synthetic biology it's a means to an end."" What can we do with the new tools of synthetic biology? Well they can improve on what's been spelled out over 3 billion years of evolution. We can take it beyond reading genomes or editing genomes and start writing genomes our own ideas of what life should be like making creatures drastically different from any that have ever existed. And how do you do that? Well already one group of scientists have rewritten and rebuilt the entire instruction kit for the very humble little yeast. And they plan to put their new recipe into a cell and if everything goes according to plan it will come alive and begin making baby yeast exactly like it's most unusual parent it will be new in the world. This synthetic yeast will break the continuous chain of evolution that links every creature back to the first living cell it will be discontinuous in a way, a thing unto itself. And then where do we take this new technology,? How far should we or will we go?"

Introduction to Bone Biology,inqWoakkiTc,BIO,"The human skeleton gives the body its shape and provides physical support for the systems contained within. It also forms part of the musculoskeletal system that enables us to move. The structure of bone is optimized so that it is strong but relatively lightweight. The interior of bone is composed of bone marrow. It is surrounded by two major types of bone tissue: cortical bone, or the hard, outer shell of bone, and trabecular bone, the spongey-looking center. The amount of each type of tissue in bone is dependent on the function of that bone. The basic unit of cortical or compact bone is the osteon. It is composed of successive, concentric lamellae. This structure contributes to bone strength by resisting bending. Cells called osteocytes are distributed within the concentric lamellae. Osteocytes form a complex network that is thought to be important in maintaining the viability and structural integrity of bone. At the center of the osteon is the Haversian canal. These canals contain blood vessels and nerves. The blood vessels within bone facilitate the exchange between osteocytes and the blood. Trabecular bone is present in the interior of some bones and resists compression. Osteocytes are also contained within its structure, and again play an important role in sensing local changes in strain. Trabecula are covered in a layer of flat and lining cells that are thought to be involved in the dynamic process by which bone is formed and broken down. Bone marrow is found within the interior of bones. The surrounding trabecula and vascular network provides structural support, nutrition, and a waste removal system that a heterogenous group of cells found within this space. Bone marrow is a site for hematopoiesis, the process by which the cellular components to blood are formed."
Xylem and Phloem - Transport in Plants | Biology | FuseSchool,jtuX7H05tmQ,BIO,"We could just say movement of water and minerals and movement of glucose and amino acids... But this is science, and so we like to have special terms to describe these processes! In these 3 part videos, we're going to look at the transport systems in plants for moving food, water and minerals around. We have a beating heart and circulating blood, but what do plants do? Cut a plant open, and it doesn't bleed. So what happens instead? Plants have their own systems. They have the Xylem which moves water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, and the Phloem which moves glucose, made in the leaves by photosynthesis, and amino acids to the rest of the plant. Here are the xylem and here are the phloem. Notice how the arrangement is different in the stem and the roots. The xylem and the phloem are found in groups called vascular bundles. And the position of these bundles changes for different parts of the plant. Both the xylem and the phloem are made up of rows of cells that form a continuous tube, running the whole length of the plant. The xylem vessels are made of elongated dead cells that are impermeable to water and have walls containing lignin (a woody material). Because of this, xylem vessels are tough. Which is why the vascular bundles in the roots are in the centre. They help prevent the plant being pulled out of the ground. They are also more protected in the centre. Whereas the stem has to resist being squashed and bent, and so it has the vascular bundles nearer to the edge to give the stem strength and support. The phloem vessels are made up of living cells. They transport sucrose and amino acids up and down the plant, depending upon where they are needed. Whereas, in the xylem the movement is just one way: from the roots up to the leaves. So we know that water and minerals go up the xylem, and amino acids and sucrose go up and down the phloem. But how? In the second part of this video we are going to look at the xylem and transpiration."
Spatial Biology Revealed with the GeoMx DSP by NanoString,mVhfZq8ppbc,BIO,"We all understand the value of quantitating  protein or gene expression levels in cancer,   neuroscience, and more. However,  in addition to quantitative data,   spatial context is central to gaining  deeper insights into the tissue biology. What if you could see both spatial context and  quantitative expression data all from one slide? NanoString's GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler  platform provides morphological context with   high plex protein or gene expression profiling  from just one slide. A single slide sample   is manually or automatically stained with  fluorescent reagents to targeted areas of   the tissue which allows the GeoMx DSP instrument  to capture images with morphological context. With an intuitive interface,  you can then select areas of   interest for profiling using several  approaches: by tissue morphology,   by phenotype, by individual cells, by  gridding, or by contouring the area. The key to the GeoMx DSP technology lies with  the photocleavable oligonucleotide tags that are   attached to the antibodies via a light-sensitive  linker. UV light is used to decouple the High   Plex oligo tags from the antibodies or RNA in  the selected regions of interest. Oligos are   then retrieved from the surface of the  tissue, without disturbing the tissue,   thus allowing the sample to be reused.  The oligos are then deposited into a   microtiter plate where they can then be put  on an analyzer for quantitative analysis. Now it is possible to get both morphological   context with high profiling protein  and gene expression data from just   one slide sample. Experience GeoMx Digital  Spatial Profiling technology by NanoString."
Duke Department of Cell Biology - About Us,S8ylgpLmStE,BIO,"One of the best places in the whole world to come to study receptor signaling was here at Duke University and that's really what drew me to the Cell Biology program is the interesting collaborations the Cell Biology Department has and the investigators within the Department. I had never experienced joint lab meetings and then in coming to Cellbio this was the first time that I had lab meetings with other labs and it was really interesting to see all of these labs coming together and it was the type of collaboration that they would have never had had they not had any joint lab meetings.    We cover a very broad area of topics in the Department. This is one of the exciting things about it is it's not just focused on one area but covers a broad spectrum of research. We have here at Duke within the Cell Biology Department so many different investigators working on different angles and basic Cell Biology principles all the way from the most simplest model system you could work with all the way up to mice and rats and and higher mammals And, we're really really fortunate that any microscope than we could ever need is available to us, any adaptation to the microscope can quickly be added on. The staff in the microscopy core are incredibly knowledgeable and they'll help you perform any experiment that you need to. Once you've manipulated your favorite gene there's any endpoint you can imagine that you could find here in the Department that you can start to study it. Success and moving forward into independent positions doesn't only depend on their scientific research and the number of papers they published. There are many other skills which are quite hard to learn and really require a lot of very dedicated mentoring by our faculty. So even though I had very little I had a very small skill set when it came to some of these questions I was interested in, the mentoring around me was such a great caliber that I was able to quickly come up to speed and learn these techniques. The people in the Department work exceptionally hard, the lights are on way into the night. I've also people come in very early in the morning. There's a lot of dedication and commitment to their research but also people like having fun. The grad students here in this Department are a really laid back group. It's not a really a competitive environment. It's a very helpful and collaborative environment. The folks go out to the bars on weekends. We have pub crawls every year. We have a lot of social events and the students here are great to hang out with outside of lab in addition to in lab."
Seven Life Processes | Physiology | Biology | FuseSchool,jpO52VTHecQ,BIO,[Music] look at this fish swimming in the sea or the spurred up a tree what about a bacteria or even a bumblebee don't worry i won't rhyme for the entire video but the amazing diversity of life on planet earth is truly staggering there are estimated to be between five to ten million different living species on the earth and that's excluding all the bacteria as they are really hard to count so what do they all have in common what makes something a living thing well scientists have found that all living things from the simple little amoeba all the way up to a big tall giraffe and everything in between can carry out these seven life processes the first is movement some organisms move very obviously like a cheetah the fastest animal on the planet which can run at 60 miles per hour other organisms like plants move much more slowly but all living things do move the second is respiration respiration is a process that occurs in cells to release energy that is stored in food organisms have evolved slightly different ways of doing this but all living things need energy to live and this is how they release them the third is sensitivity in order for a living organism to survive it needs to be able to sense its environment it could be to find food or shelter or avoid predators but all living things have evolved at least simple senses to do this humans have the five senses of touch taste sight sound and smell which gives us a very clear understanding of our environment the fourth process is growth all organisms grow in basic organisms the cell gets a little bit bigger in more complex organisms you get more and more cells animals tend to stop growing in adulthood but some plants can continue growing and get very big in fact the biggest living organism on the planet isn't a plant it's a fungus it's a type of honey fungus growing in oregon and is thought to be 2.4 miles across fifth is reproduction some organisms can reproduce on their own such as bacteria this is called asexual reproduction others carry out sexual reproduction using a male and female of the species bacteria can reproduce every 20 minutes an african elephant takes 22 months to carry its baby excretion is a sixth process this is not the same as pooing which is actually called egestion but excretion means getting rid of waste from chemical reactions in the organism respiration for example makes waste products and each organism needs to get rid of these this is called excretion the final process is nutrition every living organism needs some sort of food plants can make their own food by the process of photosynthesis but all other organisms have to get their food from somewhere else however the process of obtaining food by either way is called nutrition so there you have it the seven life processes you can remember them easily by learning the phrase mrs gren movement respiration sensitivity growth reproduction excretion and nutrition jim

Biology: Independent vs. Dependent Variables,nqj0rJEf3Ew,BIO,"""Independent variable"" and ""dependent variable"" are important terms related to controlled experiments. Remember, a controlled experiment is a scientific test in which all conditions are kept constant except for the variable you're testing. The independent variable is the thing you're testing in an experiment. it's often abbreviated as ""IV"" and sometimes called the ""manipulated variable"" because you change or manipulate this variable. In an experiment, the dependent variable is the thing you're observing and measuring the thing you're anticipating may be affected as a result of exposure to the independent variable. It's often abbreviated as ""DV"" and sometimes called the ""responding variable"" because it responds to the change that you make. Let's look at a few examples. Suppose your hypothesis is that if students study 15 minutes a night then they will have higher test grades than those who don't study at all. What's being changed, or manipulated? It's whether or not the student study for 15 minutes. And what's going to be observed or measured in this experiment? What do you think might be different as a result of this increased study time? You're expecting test grades will be affected. In this experiment, the independent variable is the study time. And the dependent variable - the thing you're measuring or going to observe - is the test grades. Here's another example - see if you can figure it out. This time the hypothesis is that if people who have headaches take aspirin, then they will get relief faster than those who who don't take aspirin for headaches. So, what's the thing that's different in this case? The thing that's different - the independent variable - is whether or not somebody is taking an aspirin. Then, what are you going to measure? Your measuring how long it takes for their headache to go away. That's the dependent variable. Here's a final example to help you understand these terms. You predict that if a brand-name light bulb is left on continuously, then it will burn longer than a bargain brand light bulb used in the same manner. In this case, what is the independent variable? It’s the brand name light bulb. What are you measuring? You're measuring how many hours the light bulbs work before burning out, which is the dependent variable. The independent variable is the brand name light bulb, and the dependent variable is the amount of time the light bulbs work before burning out. So to review, the independent variable is the thing that you're testing sometimes this is referred to as the cause in an experiment. It is also the ""if"" part of your hypothesis. The dependent variable the thing you're measuring is the effect. It is also the ""then"" part of your hypothesis."
Welcome to The Biology of Human Cancer Course!,E-Y6GH7gaSo,BIO,"My name is Daniel Benhamin. And I've been an instructor at UC Berkeley Extension since 2017. I'll be teaching the biology of human cancer. I received my PhD from UC Berkeley in the field of cancer metabolism, where I studied how cancer cells metabolize nutrients differently from normal cells. And by understanding these metabolic differences, I was able to work towards developing chemotherapeutic strategies to specifically target cancer cells and not normal cells. You should take this biology of human cancer course if you're interested in understanding the fundamental mechanisms that allow a normal cell to become cancer. And by understanding these mechanisms, we can then be in a better position to understand how to both prevent and treat this devastating disease. The field of cancer biology is one of the most rapidly growing fields in all of science. And that is reflected in this class. The things that we learn have, often, only recently been discovered six to eight months before the class has started. In fact, at some point in the class, we will learn things that haven't even been discovered right now. And we'll learn about them together as they are being discovered. The reason why I love UC Berkeley Extension so much myself is because we cater to nontraditional students. We understand that students have jobs and lives outside of the classroom. And we try to foster a learning environment that caters specifically to these kinds of students. So not only will students be able to interact with both me and their fellow students in real time, live online on Zoom, but they'll also be able to interact with their fellow students on Canvas via discussion. So they can post a discussion question. And students can come at any time they want and answer that question. And in fact, what I find so amazing about this course and about the students who take this course is that because they come from such diversity of backgrounds, they can learn so much from each other."
Master | Biological Sciences: General Biology (track) | University of Amsterdam,8FqcwfuB6sM,BIO,"This programme is unique... because it allows students to really create their own programme. So the key words here are independence of the students... and irrespective of what you as a student want... we will help you in reaching your goals. In this programme you start out with a couple of courses... but most of the time is spent on projects, into research... or for instance honing your skills into societal problems or communication. I think I chose General Biology because I have very broad interests within the field of biology. And this track really allows me to pick and choose different courses... from all the various disciplines within the broad field of biology. So I think that's to be the flexibility that the programme gives you as a student. You're allowed to take courses from all the different tracks in the biological sciences master's. But it also allows you to for example extend your research project... if you really love doing research or even honing other types of skills. I think I would say it's not a bad thing to sort of stay curious have very broad interests. It's a good thing to know sort of the direction you want to go in terms of a job in a future... But it's never a bad thing to sort of diversify your skills, your knowledge or experience. So stay curious I would say. So far I've mainly focused on learning how to do research. I've done research projects at the University of Amsterdam... and I'm looking for another project outside of the university. But I've also very interested in science communication... learning how to communicate the results of science... back to society through media platforms. And this track also allows me to combine the two... so I'm planning to follow maybe a science communication major... after I complete my research internship... so I can really learn how to communicate science back to society."
Basic Molecular Biology: Laboratory Practice – The Laboratory Working Areas,cmM8TZdgWXk,BIO,Laboratory materials must follow uni-directional  workflow through separate working areas to minimize   contamination. In the first step of a specimen  processing the PCR reagent mix is prepared in area A. In step 2 the prepared mix is transferred to area  B. Never transfer any laboratory materials from   Area B to Area A. In step 3 nucleic acid extraction is performed in Area B where the extracted nucleic acid from the specimen is added to the PCR reagent mix. In step 4 the PCR product goes through  an amplification process in Area C. In step 5 the post amplification PCR product is analyzed in Area D.
Evolution by Natural Selection - Darwin&#39;s Finches | Evolution | Biology | FuseSchool,s64Y8sVYfFY,BIO,"What are Darwin's finches and why are they so important to biologists? Study of finches led to the development of one of the most important scientific theories of all time, but how does this come about?   In December 1831 a naturalist called Charles Darwin boarded the HMS beagle bound on a surveying voyage to South America Whilst the ship and crew carried out coastline surveys Darwin was free to explore the islands in route in 1855 the Beagle arrived at the Galapagos Islands near Ecuador What darwin found there surprised him greatly? As well as giant tortoises and Marine iguanas don't collected and preserved a variety of different song Birds called finches Upon returning to the uk he examined them together with ornithologist John gould and later fascinating discoveries? The scientists observed that the birds were all similar to a single type of finch found on Mainland, South America Suggesting that these  mainland finches had originally colonized the Island however the Galapagos finches were all slightly different from the original mainland species and They were also different from each other the finches on each Island show distinct variations in their overall size big shape and claw size These differences were attributed to the different food sources available on the various islands of the Galapagos Some of the birds had long thin beaks and sharp claws suited to catching and eating insects while others had large powerful beasts suitable for cracking over the nuts Because of the distances between the islands breeding between different species of finch was unlikely and down Concluded that the finches must have evolved over time from the original mainland species to suit the conditions found on each individual Island in All 13 of the Birds brought that by Darwin who identified as being entirely new species all similar to each other but with definite variations from their common ancestor Darwin propose that the variations seen both within and between the same species arose by chance Variations which gave any individual comparative advantage made them more likely [to] survive and therefore reproduce out competing those with less Advantageous characteristics Darwin called this theory natural selection, and he published it [as] book on the origin of species in 1859 Evolution by natural selection is now widely agreed to be the most accurate theory to explain the origin and diversity of all life on Earth in this video you've learned how the finches of the Galapagos islands led to the development of the theory of evolution by [natural] selection Evolution of these birds still happening see what you can find out"
Master of Science in Cellular and Molecular Biology: Advanced Training for Successful Research,rEBDdAjdmgs,BIO,"""Our program is designed to teach students a broad background in cellular and molecular biology, so they'll really learn the concepts and the techniques that they'll need in order to work in a molecular and cell biology research setting. So everybody comes in and they take a few core courses, including a genomics course, biochemistry courses, and molecular biology, and then there are a few electives that they can also take that rotate. So we'll teach things about pharmacology We'll teach things about cancer biology Neurobiology, and then there are three labs that we also teach in which we really teach the students not only how to do the research but really how to design an experiment and interpret the data. And we also have recently opened up a new zebrafish facility that allows us to use zebrafish as a model system. Which is a really great opportunity for small universities such as ours and all of these are the skills that will help them be successful in a research laboratory setting."""
What Are Hormones | Physiology | Biology | FuseSchool,lRJE8c3ghRE,BIO,what are hormones a hormone is a chemical messenger that is secreted or released into our bloodstream by specific organs known as glands hormones regulate or control many processes in our body including blood glucose levels water content in blood general growth and blood pressure just to name a few as an example thyroxine which is a hormone secreted by a thyroid gland helps to regulate metabolism in other lessons you will learn about a few of these hormones in more detail several hormones are secreted by the pituitary gland located right below the hypothalamus in your brain instructions are given by the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland according to current conditions in our body the secreted hormones travel through the bloodstream to target organs where either a specific response is directly produced or it stimulates or causes the target organ to secrete its own hormones we can think of this like a post office system hormones or posts must reach the correct target organs or addresses for the right response to occur feeling thirsty when the hypothalamus detects low levels of water in blood it signals or tells the pituitary gland to release a hormone called the anti-diuretic hormone or adh into your bloodstream adh travels to your kidneys in this case the target organ and causes water to be absorbed so urine becomes more concentrated and output is decreased drinking more water increases the water content in your blood which then causes the hypothalamus to signal the pituitary gland to secrete less adh less adh means your kidneys will absorb less water causing urine to become less concentrated and output is increased ever felt suddenly frightened when threatened the brain activates neurons that stimulate the adrenal gland located right above your kidneys to rapidly secrete adrenaline adrenaline then acts on your heart and lungs to increase heart rate and breathing rate this along with other physiological responses is known as the fight-or-flight response and is activated very quickly at the same time the hypothalamus signals the pituitary gland to secrete the adrenocorticotropic hormone which travels to the adrenal glands to secrete a hormone known as cortisol cortisol acts in target organs to allow the body to adapt long-term distress so to review hormones are chemical messengers secreted by glands into the bloodstream and produce a specific response when they reach the target organ you
Basic Molecular Biology: Basic Science – RNA Structure,9LoGaBqPkac,BIO,"Ribonucleic Acid or RNA is  similar in structure to DNA   but is involved in very different cellular  functions. Similar to DNA structure, RNA consists   of the same basic elements, a sugar-phosphate  backbone, and four nitrogen bases. However,   there are three major differences that account for  the very different functions of the two molecules.  RNA is a single-strand nucleic acid  which, while more unstable than DNA,   allows flexibility to bend back on itself forming  weak bonds with another part of the same molecule.  Secondly, RNA has a ribose sugar  instead of a deoxyribose sugar like DNA   which is important for enzymes  that distinguish DNA from RNA.  Lastly, RNA has a uracil nitrogen base instead of  thymine allowing the base-pair complementary rule:   Adenine binds to Uracil, and  Cytosine binds to Guanine.  For orientation purposes, the carbon atoms  in the ribose sugar are numbered similarly   1 through 5 with corresponding 3 prime  and 5 prime ends. Adjoining nucleotides   add onto the 3 prime hydroxyl  group of the previous nucleotide.   Functionally, cells contain a variety of  forms of RNA including: messenger RNA or mRNA,   transfer RNA or tRNA, and ribosomal  RNA or rRNA. Each form assists in the   many functions of the cell such as coding,  decoding, regulating, and expressing genes."
Fundamental Concepts: Biology,-noMqxUTRc8,BIO,"Just think for a second about how  biology affects us on a day-to-day basis,   even on a moment-to-moment basis. Have you ever  thought about how very important processes like   walking and talking, or even promoting respiration  or digestion can be controlled by tiny little   molecules? So you may have read in your news feed  news about changing environment, perhaps climate   change, perhaps even ecology. But what do any  of those actually mean? I have students ask me   all the time, if I want to be a conservation  biologist what is the best way that I can do   that? Plants are actually at the center of some  of the major problems facing the world today.   So the tree is one of the most important ways  that evolutionary biologists and anthropologists   think about the evolutionary process. When  we understand our own evolution it helps   us see how we're connected to other  living species on the planet today."
Pomona College Biology Professor Daniel Martinez on Gene Order Research,3sRA-wgP6cc,BIO,"- [Narrator] Imagine four decks of cards, each with the same number of cards in identical order. Now imagine those card decks being shuffled continuously for 48 straight hours. What are the odds that when you finished all that shuffling, the cards in each deck would still be in the exact same order? Might not work for cards, but new research in the journal ""Science Advances"" reveals that after 700 million years of evolutionary forces, genes in animals are still found in the same order on chromosomes. The number of chromosomes varies widely across the animal kingdom. Humans have 23 pairs while fruit flies only have four. Dogs have way more chromosome pairs with 39 than cats with 19 pairs. No matter, the genes on the chromosomes are still arranged in the same order. Here's Pomona College biology professor and co-author of the study, Daniel Martinez, with a little more on this. - So it is an absolutely surprising finding. Chromosomes break all the time. They rearrange, they can get together and form another chromosome. I think that we expected there would be a lot more freedom from gene order to change. It is pretty amazing that animals have maintained gene order in chromosomes in such a neat way."
EMBL Hamburg’s services and facilities for structural biology support neuroscience research,vg5qLQfvdf8,BIO,"﻿A lot of effort has been put into researching  psychiatric disorders, but there is still no cure. It could be because we don't have a complete picture of the exact molecular mechanisms. Structural biology is one of the best ways to understand  how small molecule drugs interact with the target protein. I'm Azadeh Shahsavar. I'm a structural biologist at the research lab of Poul Nissen at DANDRITE, which is the Danish node of Nordic EMBL partnership. In this project, we wanted to  study the glycine transporter GlyT1 that sits at the cell membrane in the  brain and modulates neuronal activity. Over the past two decades, many research groups have tried to find a way to inhibit GlyT1 and this way to treat psychiatric disorders. But even the most advanced inhibitors have failed in latest stages of  clinical trials studies. And we want to understand why. We aim to determine the three-dimensional structure of GlyT1 to be able to see and understand how inhibitors interact with the protein. I'm Gleb Bourenkov; I'm coming originally from Russia and I’m a beamline scientist at EMBL Hamburg. I'm working very closely with users from all over Europe,  helping them conduct their research. EMBL Hamburg provides rather unique service, and what we're offering ranges from  sample preparation and characterisation through the X-ray experiments and data  acquisition to data analysis and interpretation. Crystallisation of membrane proteins in general, and GlyT1 in particular, is not a straightforward task. EMBL Hamburg was absolutely critical in crystallising GlyT1 and collecting data was only possible at the powerful bright microfocus P14 beamline. We actually achieved such a power of the X-ray beams, that the experiment on single sample that takes roughly one minute we managed to scale it down to a fraction of a second. But EMBL is more than just excellent science and excellent infrastructure. It's also its people, their passion for science and  their dedication to enable research at its best. When we collected diffraction data from several hundreds of GlyT1 microcrystals   the available software wasn't successful in analysing them. Scientists at EMBL Hamburg developed a script that could successfully analyse such data.   Once we determined the 3D structure of GlyT1, we were actually surprised  because we didn't expect the inhibitor to bind the protein where it's binding. I believe it will form the basis for further pharmaceutical efforts to find different strategies targeting this protein in the brain."
Feral Hog Biology Basics,4ZBLQnsF_IY,BIO,"wild pigs have been in the United States since the early fifteen hundreds and in Texas since the mid fifteen hundreds and they are considered to be an exotic species brought in from Europe and Asia and this particular species has established itself well throughout the United States with some 46 states now with populations established. in Texas unfortunately we have probably the largest wild pig population of any state in the country with about 2.6 million head. With pigs in Texas the last four hundred fifty years were looking more at managing the damage those pigs cause and not necessarily eradication. And in Texas we estimate that wild pigs do a conservative $52 million damage to agriculture alone with landowner spending an additional $7 million to control the pigs to correct the damage that they cause. Where this large population and this amount of damage that pigs can cause and occupying some 90 to 95 percent of Texas counties, landowners need to be vigilant about watching for sign of wild pigs on their property certainly watching for damage that they cause and be prepared to manage that damage any time it occurs. If you don't have wild pigs today you could well have wild pigs tomorrow because they can move great distances and establish new populations. Certainly our establishment of populations has been exacerbated by the trailering and release of wild pigs across the landscape in Texas over the last 30 to 50 years, primarily for hunting purposes but yet this has led to increasing damage as I mentioned to agriculture across the state. Wild pigs at 2.6 million head in Texas, we're estimating we're removing about 750,000 wild pigs from that population annually which represents about 29 percent of the total population. Unfortunately in order to hold that population stable we need to be removing between 50 and 70 percent of the population just to keep it from increasing so we're falling short of that goal at the present times by the legal methods that we have are trapping, shooting, snaring, and the use of trained dogs. Part of the problem with the increasing population is the high reproductive rate that wild pigs possess. They're capable of producing a couple litters a year with an average of between five and six pigs per litter. this makes them the most reproductively successful large mammal found worldwide. So an increase in population is almost guaranteed any place they can establish in habitat that meets their requirements for food cover water and living space."
Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology (UNIGE),RLgoafysfnI,BIO,"The aim is really to understand the basics of life from whole organisms down to the atomic structure of biomolecules essential for living cells. This fundamental knowledge of how cells grow, divide, differentiate into tissues or organism is absolutely essential for us to understand the mechanism underlying some diseases such as cancer, and to develop in the future new therapeutic approaches. The Department studies different topics, from genome stability, gene expression and chromatin regulation to signaling and cell cycle processes. And to tackle this important problem we use a wide range of methods from genetic to genome wide analysis, but also using CryoEM to understand the molecular architecture of the cell to an atomic level. Studying basic research in which probably the clinical translation of that is still very far away is fundamental. Fundamental not only because it's the first step into developing something that will be practical, but also because it's in the very human nature, trying to explore unknown territories, either geographically or intellectually. Being curious is probably the most fundamental part of being a scientist and having questions to answer is the first step into answering them. I think that the most interesting thing about how to generate good questions it really starts like earlier in your career,  probably as a PhD student or even before. The Department has been a pioneer in developing electron microscopy and many famous scientists have been hosted in the Department over the past decades and had a substantial contribution  in our current understanding of basic cellular and molecular processes. My lab uses biochemistry, molecular and cellular biology, super resolution and CryoEM to better understand how the cell divides and this at an atomic level. And we train our students with the most recent method and novel concept in biology to prepare them for the very rapidly evolving scientific world. We look for highly motivated and passionate students who want to step out of their comfort zone to undertake new challenging projects to better understand the really fascinating complexity of life and also uncover all the mechanistic details of how it all works."

Biology of SARS-CoV-2: Infection | HHMI BioInteractive Video,LoVJCx6XXMM,BIO,"[CRICKETS CHIRPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] SPEAKER: This is the virus SARS-CoV-2. Its name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. You may have heard it called just the coronavirus, or COVID-19. Coronaviruses are actually a family of viruses that include SARS-CoV-2, and COVID-19 is the name of the disease caused by it. Coronaviruses infect humans and other animals. In humans, they cause the common cold and, in some cases, more serious respiratory diseases. All coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have a genome made of a single strand of RNA which is surrounded by a membrane made of lipids and proteins. This membrane is called an envelope. Coronaviruses are named after what looks like a crown of protein spikes that stick out of their envelope. Coronaviruses enter the body mainly through the mouth or nose. The virus then has to get inside a human cell. The protein spikes in the virus's envelope attach to specific proteins on the surface of a cell. This causes the virus's membrane to fuse with the cell's membrane, releasing the virus's RNA genome into the cell. The cell's ribosomes translate the virus's RNA into proteins, including viral RNA polymerase. The RNA polymerase transcribes the virus's RNA, making more RNA copies that are translated into proteins. It also makes more copies of the virus's whole genome. The new viral genome and proteins combine to make a new virus that is packaged into an envelope formed from the cells membranes. Newly-formed viruses travel to the cell's surface and are released outside the cell. These viruses can infect other cells or leave the body in mucus and saliva droplets. This can all happen even if a person doesn't feel sick or show symptoms of disease. A fever or coughing are usually signs that the immune system is fighting the infection. The production of new viruses continues until the body's immune system is able to eliminate the infection. [MUSIC PLAYING]"
"Bioinformatics and Systems Biology (MSc), DTU",WX9pX_NE6_Y,BIO,"    On my bachelor I studied Biotechnology, so I designed a lot of lab experiments and I worked in a lot of different organisms, but one thing that was the same for every project was that I always had to do some sort of bioinformatics.   There is all this data out there. So like in the 90s people started sequencing the human genome, and it took more than 10 years and it cost 3 billion dollars and now you can do it in a day for... Yeah I think now even less than 1000 dollars. So biotechnology and synthetic biology has moved so much within the past decade and is still just developing exponentially, but that also means that we have to be so much better at analysing the data, because it doesn't help if you can produce the data, if you don't understand what it means, or can store it too... And I'm interested in working with these problems and analysing this data. I am a part of DTU's iGEM team 2015. It is sort of a collaborative community in synthetic biology so every year about 200 teams of university students all around the world make their own projects in their lab at their schools and then then they meet up in Boston in the fall and present these projects. It is a lot of work but of course, it is also very rewarding, because you get to be a part of this amazing community of students that are super engaged and super excited about synthetic biology."

Biology and Self Organization,ZJ272i1Bhqo,BIO,"So I've been thinking a lot about this idea of biology as something with almost a kind of agency, right? A kind of directionality. Not to get metaphysical here, but you could actually think of the 10 trillion cells that self organize and collaborate to become the meta organism that is a human being means that biology seems to exhibit a kind of protoplasmic yearning, a desire to self organize. There seems to be conditions in this universe that engender novelty, complexity sprouts, mind emerges from matter and then starts to manipulate matter at the level of the atom with nanotechnology. It's like human beings seem to be the cutting edge, the evolutionary pinnacle of self awareness becoming aware of its becoming, right? It's almost like the birth of mind folds the attention back and looks at its own heritage and starts to put itself into context. The universe comes to know itself through human beings. We've decommissioned natural selection, Edward O. Wilson says, and now we must look deep within ourselves and decide what we wish to become."

Marine Biology Department at California State University Long Beach,iJbowr0r9xA,BIO,"So you think if I want to understand how life on earth works, I want to understand how life in the oceans work. We want you to do the science. You know we want you to experience that and know what it's like. In our program, undergraduates get a very heavy introduction very quick, and that is unique. You will be doing real experiments and putting yourself in a position where you can be published because of your undergraduate research project. You have a really immediate access to rocky inter tidal, sandy beaches, estuaries. We have small boats so we can go offshore. We have a diving program. We have access to a 76 foot research vessel so we can go offshore. First of all we have a long history. We've been doing it since 1969. We have over 900 alumni from our program and they're in every aspect of marine science that you could possibly imagine. And they're all over the world. One of the classes I teach is called marine ichthyology. It's the study of marine fish. And I get to actually teach this class out at Catalina. Students spend four weeks with me. They are completely immersed in marine fishes. And the great thing there is I can lecture about what fish do and about their biology and their form and function, and then literally an hour later they're in the water seeing it. There's no better place to learn marine biology than at a Marine Lab like that. We have a wide variety of electives that students take as they're graduating. Things like marine microbiology and marine mammalogy and wetlands ecology. Just so many different great marine electives and that's what really gets the students understanding and knowing kind of what they want to do with their lives when they graduate. I think one of the best things about our program is that the students get to go in the field as soon as they get here and they get immersed in marine biology. One of he most unique things about our program is that the students get to take marine biology their very first semester. And we're so close to the ocean that they actually can go on field trips to the ocean within lab time, which means that every student in every class gets to do field trips. We have a marine lab. That's one of our greatest assets. In there students can become research assistants or teaching assistants where they're teaching through the interactions with the organisms. I think students really walk away feeling more confident. In searching for a job and internship in my later years at school I had found that people that went to Long Beach knew people from Long Beach. They know the classes you take and they like what you know. So the classes here are designed to help us get the information we need to succeed in this major. The faculty here at Cal State Long Beach is really helpful. Their doors are always open too they will give you advice not just for classes but also just make sure you're on top of it for applying your next steps. Whether it's grad school or a job. I actually got a couple of my undergrad jobs through faculty that would reach out to me and say ""hey, this exists you should go do this."" They take care of you and they make sure you're doing what you should do to progress. They're actually doing science that it's actually real. It's reak data. It's not some made-up worksheet that they gonna analyze. And so you know that's a really, again I think a really exciting component of a lot of the courses."
Marine Biology Program at Hillsdale College,qCCY34aAYEc,BIO,"Marine biology is a very unique opportunity for the students. They're immersed in the subject, living and working together. It is a summer course. One day represents essentially a week of work in a typical semester. The day to day schedule is pretty intense. Lectures begin at 8AM, and then after lecture they head out to their research site. And depending on what week we are in they'll be doing different activities at the research site. - And then we usually have some type of excursion on the boat. So that involves scuba diving or snorkeling. We come back and we usually have a two hour break, and then we have four to five hours of lab at night. There's something about living with a smaller group, studying the same material, and going on the same excursions, doing things together that just is much more fun than in a classroom. It makes biology a lot more real and a lot more interesting. - We went scuba diving at Sombrero Reef. It was amazing. So it was cool to be on my own and just explore, see all the fish and all the colors, and explore the caves that the eels were hiding in. It was just a great experience. - I think it's very important that a student find out what they're passionate about and pursue it. And as many opportunities as they have to find out what their passion is or isn't is a good thing. - I am starting a Masters program at the University of Delaware in the fall studying microbial ecology. This trip definitely made me more sure that I was doing what I really wanted to do. It has a pretty strong research component, and I really liked that. And then just kind of working through that whole process was pretty valuable in the decision to go to grad school for biology. - My plan after I graduated was to work in an aquarium. And I just realised after this trip that's actually what I really want to do. - [Anthony] And regardless of major, it's just a unique experience. - I'm double majoring in economics and German. I decided to come on this trip because I never really experienced the bio side of Hillsdale, and I though this is more fun and more intensive than Bio 101 but I don't have the distraction of any other classes. - [Anthony] Well, I wanted to make something meaningful, more than just teaching techniques. It is such a unique experience."
TXST Research - Biology Field Methods,grrdt22KA-E,BIO,"(peaceful music) - Today, we're out here at Spring Lake, which is one of my favorite places, and we are gonna be catching some turtles and some fish through different sorts of trapping techniques that we're learning that are associated with our majors. This class is huge for us wildlife majors that want to go into the field of wildlife biology research and fieldwork, 'cause it's giving us techniques that we will actually use on the job. So it's preparing us for a career that is sooner than we think it is, actually. The techniques that I'm learning through this class, I get to put on my resume and they help me when I apply for jobs. I can tell them, not only am I interested in this research, I actually know how to conduct it, which makes it easier for me to get jobs and helps me feel more prepared for the career that I want to go for. So many of my professors have inspired me with their own journeys within this career and kind of showed me what I can do next. And they're always there to answer questions and help me out along the way. It's been awesome. (peaceful music)"
My career in genomics: cancer biology,olCINId56j0,BIO,"I'm Niki, I'm a research assistant in the Cancer Genome Project at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge. My job has a lot of variation to it, and that really keeps things fresh. It can be extracting DNA and RNA from tissues and bloods, it can be setting up loads and loads of reactions on a robot, or it can be quite computer and admin paper based. Extractions are my favourite part of the job, because you get to see the science happening right in front of you. We normally get a tumour or a blood sample in,  and sometimes we get normal tissues as well. And what we do first, is we break it up into really small chunks, so the chemicals we use can actually get into the cells and pull the DNA out. Once we've got it out, we check what we've got and if its good quality and then it goes off for sequencing. We use robots in the labs to make our lives easier, the other day I had a ticket in for 1344 reactions, which if I had to by hand would have taken weeks. But with the robots it's a lot easier, you just tell it what to do, it goes and does it for you and it only took me a couple of days. In the lab we have a ticketing system, there's two sides to it, a digital side and a paper side. The digital side normally  comes first, and on that we have the big list of everything that is going on or will go on and you take the highest priority ticket and it's really  simple just drop down and take it. Then the paper side comes in, you take that through with you into the lab, and you sign off things as you're doing them,  if you're not done by the end of the day you put it in the ""in progress"" draw and when it's finished you take it and put it in the ""finished draw"" and then update the digital one and say everything is done. So I really like it because it gives nice structure to the lab and you know exactly what's going on. I have a degree in genetics and my first job, shortly after graduating, was at a cold and flu research company. I was running the lab at a satellite screening site, and because it was satellite it was quite lonely, I was the only person that was always in the lab, and it got to the point when I was like ""I'm not really using my degree"". Genetics and Sanger, it's kinda of a  goal, it's a really big deal if you do genetics, to get here. So I kept trying and trying and trying, I think I had about 3 interviews and 8 applications and eventually I got it. I really enjoy what I'm doing now, I'm finally at a place where I'm using my degree and it's paid off, all that hard work. But I'm now at the point where I've got it decide if I want to stay at the Sanger and carrying on working and growing with them, or if I want to go back into education, get a master's, get a PhD and go and get more into the academic and research side of things myself. But either way, I've got Sanger on my CV and that's going to give me  so many opportunities that I wouldn't have had otherwise."
Quantitative Biology Workshop | MITx on edX | Course About Video,W453MONQqLI,BIO,"SPEAKER 1: This is a biologist. He does lab stuff, like cell culture. He performs experiments and produces lots of data. But he doesn't have a clue as to how to analyze that data on his own. BIOLOGIST: Hey! Yeah, well, that's true. SPEAKER 1: This is a computer scientist. He does computer stuff, like coding and Python and Matlab. He creates algorithms to solve complex problems, but he doesn't know how his work applies to the data that biologists produce. COMPUTER SCIENTIST: Biology? What do data structures have to do with mice? SPEAKER 1: This is a computational biologist. COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGIST: I use machine learning to study brain activity, Matlab to manipulate data on the neuro-science division, and Python, to process data on the differentiation of heart muscle cells. SPEAKER 1: Wow, guys. Maybe you should learn something from her. COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGIST: Well, actually you can. We've put together a series of online workshops called 7.QBWx, Quantitative Biology Workshop. We've designed exercises to help you get started applying quantitative tools to solve biological problems. Do you want to give it a try? Some students visiting MIT already have. SPEAKER 2: I came to this course because I am very interested in trying to do interdisciplinary research and computer science, because I think that's the way of the future. ALEJANDRO VINTOS DELVALLE: Biological systems are just so complicated that there is no feasible way that any one person is going to be able to do any kind of meaningful analysis without the help of computers. DANIELLE ADEKUNLE: I never thought that I would say that I like math or computation. But now it's really fun, especially when you see the application when you're approaching biological problems, and you can see how math and quantitation can really contribute and help and make research more efficient. TALMO PEREIRA: Doing this through the MITx's CourseWare website really does give us a more interactive approach to learn this material. JEFF GORE: Three, two, one. All right. Do we have a fair number of different answers, which is perfect. TALMO PEREIRA: It's really quite a privilege to be able to be here and listen to lectures with world-renowned professors. DANIELLE ADEKUNLE: The workshop exceeded my expectations and had a huge impact on my future career plans. SPEAKER 1: Join us in 7.QBWx and learn how computer science has transformed biology."
Fungi: Why Mushrooms Are Awesome | Biology for Kids,2fooP2ienR0,BIO,"Squeaks and  I were just deciding what to have for lunch, and we’re thinking: pizza! You’ve probably heard of the topping I want on mine, but it’s a little out of the ordinary. I’ll give you a hint: it has lots of vitamins and minerals. But it’s not a plant, so it’s not broccoli or peppers or olives, though I do love all of those vegetables! And it doesn’t come from an animal, so it’s not sausage or pepperoni, though I do like those, too! Can you guess what I’m thinking of? [Squeaks] I’m going to have some mushrooms! That’s right — mushrooms aren’t plants, and they aren’t animals, either. [Squeaks] Mushrooms are a type of fungus! Fungi are a whole separate kind of living thing — not plants, and not animals. Some of them look a lot like the mushrooms I’ll be having on my pizza. But others are much weirder! There’s black witches’ butter, which is a type of fungus called a jelly fungus. I bet you can guess why — it looks a lot like dark, thick jelly! Then there’s the brain mushroom, which looks a lot like … well, a brain. There are even mushrooms that glow in the dark! Fungi might seem like plants from the outside, because many of them grow from the ground. But scientists have made some pretty cool discoveries about fungi that make them different from plants! For example, one thing that makes plants special is that they make their own food out of sunlight. That’s how all plants eat, but fungi can’t do it! Instead, they have to get their food from other living things, just like us animals. That’s also why you might see mushrooms growing in dark places – they don’t need the sunlight! But plants won’t grow in the dark. Also, get this, when you look at a fungus really close up, you can tell that they’re actually made of some of the same stuff as animals, not plants! But remember, fungi aren’t animals, either. For one thing, even though fungi have to seek out their food since they can’t make it themselves like plants do, they can’t run or walk or even fly to get it like animals. Fungi actually grow right on top of their own food. Mushrooms, for example, eat dead plants, which is why they often grow on trees or the forest floor. As fungi get bigger, they’re able to absorb, or soak up, more and more food. They’re pretty special that way. When animals like you and me break down our food and turn it into energy, we do it inside our bodies. Our stomachs add special stomach juices to the food in our bodies to break it down more easily. Fungi digest food in a totally different way! They add stomach juices to their food, too, but they spread it right on what they’re eating, so the food gets broken down outside of their bodies, not on the inside! Then, after the food is broken down, the fungi just soak up what’s left over. [Squeaks thinks this is cool] I agree — fungi are pretty awesome! Especially mushrooms. But even though a lot of mushrooms are good for you, like the ones on pizza, we definitely don’t want to go picking mushrooms ourselves That’s because there are sooooo many different types of mushrooms in the world, and some of them could make you really sick if you eat them. They can give people a stomach ache, or make them feel like throwing up, or much worse! And some of the mushrooms that are bad for you actually look a lot like mushrooms that are good for you! So we leave the mushroom-growing to the experts and don’t pick them ourselves. Now, I think it’s about time we go get some pizza! Thanks for joining us!

Concentration gradients | Membranes and transport | Biology | Khan Academy,CNP-dCQ-Cmg,BIO,"- In the first video where we introduced the idea of diffusion and concentration gradients, we had a container with only one type of particle in it, we had these purple particles. And in our starting scenario we had a higher concentration of the purple particles on the left-hand side than we had on the right-hand side. And so if we looked at its concentration gradient, so the concentration gradient went from high concentration on the left to low concentration on the right. And we saw what happened. Since you have more of these particles here and they're all bouncing around in different directions randomly, you have a higher probability of things moving from the left to the right than from the right to the left. You will have things move from the right to the left, but you're going to have more things, so you'll have a higher probability of things, moving from left to right. And so if you let some time pass, then they become more uniformly spread across a container. They have moved down their concentration gradient to make things more uniform. Now, what's interesting about this diagram is I've introduced a second particle, these big yellow particles. And we see that their concentration gradient is going in the other direction. So we have a low concentration, in fact we have no, on the left-hand, we have none of the yellow particles on the left-hand side, and we have a high concentration on the right-hand side. So their concentration gradient goes from right to left. And the whole point of this video is to show that each particle moves down its unique concentration gradient, assuming that it's not blocked in some way, it's going to move down its unique concentration gradient irrespective of what the other particles are going to do, for the most part. And so we see the yellow particles are going to move from high concentration, to low concentration. They're going to move, they're going to diffuse from right to left. And once again, there's no magic here. It's not like this molecule is saying, oh, I've got seven other of my friends here, it's getting too crowded, I see them, I'm claustrophobic, let me move over to the left-hand side. That's not what's going on. They're just all randomly bouncing around and when you're in the starting position, when you're exactly like this, there's no probability because of a yellow particle moving from left to right, because there aren't any yellow particles here. While there's a probability that some of these particles, in a certain amount of time, some of these yellow particles could move from right to left. And so they'll keep doing that until you get to a stable configuration where now you have an equal probability of things moving from left to right, and right to left. And that's going to be true for each of these particles. So the real takeaway, you'll hear in a biology or a chemistry class, of things moving down their concentration gradient, and you might say, and their unique concentration gradient. As you see, the yellow particles' concentration gradient goes in the other direction as the purple particles, but there's no magic to this. You just have to imagine a bunch of things just bouncing around in a bunch of different directions, and then what would just naturally happen? You would naturally have a higher probability of moving from high concentration to low concentration, than from low concentration to high concentration."
Cultivating Discovery: Undergraduate Research in UW Biology,eRAfphm7Eac,BIO,"I lived most of my live in Ferndale, Washington, which is about 2 hours north of Seattle. And my parents really had emphasized throughout my entire life that you know, college was the key. Just because they immigrated here as adults. They knew that they wanted us to succeed, to have a better life than they did. I remember one day I was sitting in pre-calculus and my counselor comes running in through the door and she's like, Jesus! and I'm like I'm here... And she pulled me out of class, and she was like, you should apply to this and she had in her hand the application for the University of Washington ALVA genOM project. It turned out to be really transformative. It was a nine week long intensive bio-research project and they placed me into my lab, into Veronica Di Stilio’s lab. For the past almost four years I've been studying the evolution and development of flowers. She's been a fantastic mentor throughout this time. Her lab has really been conducive to my learning science and to build the skills I need to succeed as a scientist. She did a really good job of giving me my own project. They're like we have this flower and it's a mutant, and we know it's a mutant, but we don't know what's mutated in it so it's your job to figure out what's mutated in it. So since then I've kind of taken the lead on that project, as far as figuring out you know, what's the next step. I feel like, with my experience I'm ready and I'm prepared and I have been doing things for a long time some people have just started in the past two years or you know some people had to take an extra two years to tech, or get a masters to be as prepared as I am. I wouldn't be traveling around the country interviewing for grad schools if I didn't do reserach and I wouldn't be pursuing a profession in sciences if I hadn't done research throughout my undergraduate career. When you succeed it's not just yourself, it's rarely just yourself, you're standing on the shoulders of everyone who supported you. I didn't know anything about what it actually meant to be a scientist before I came to the University of Washington. It's crazy to think how far I've gone in these four years. Like I've gone from being this, you know, guy from Ferndale who knows how to weld and likes science little bit to someone who's prepared to start a PhD program and is ready to like succeed as an academic and that's crazy."
In the Field with Marine Biology – The #DiscoverUNB Vlog,-mwWPBUmnZY,BIO,"A friend! -Can you put it in your hand? -Yeah! Don't be rude! Hi guys! My name is Gabrielle Fader, I'm a second-year nursing student and I'm from Halifax, Nova Scotia. We are just on our way to Green's Point Lighthouse to visit the marine semester. and we are just driving through St. George On our way there! *lighthearted music* We're here! So the students are doing a full semester of experiential-based learning activities both in the field and in the lab. This is one of our core programs  of our marine biology major. so they're... they've been living at the Huntsman for nine weeks they have three weeks to go. They're here with me today to work on three projects related to an adaptation course,  adaptation of marine organisms and so we're going to be sampling  sponges, snails and crabs from wave-sheltered areas here As well as more wave-exposed areas around the point of L'Etete and we're going to be comparing the morphology, the behaviour of the animals from those different habitats. Awesome! I'm excited to get started! *cinematic synth music* So, Jill, you've been here for nine weeks now How do you feel? How was your experience? It is a lot of fun, it's a lot of hands-on work which is really nice, it's a lot of interacting with what you're actually learning and not just sitting down and reading about things it's actually about getting to experience it So tell us about your favourite part. Definitely the excursions, like the field work that we do. Coming to places like Green's Point and Sam Orr Pond and to all those places. It's a lot of fun going there. So you do this often, where you'll come here? Usually once or twice a week, depending on  what we're doing that week. Unlike these biologists, I'm getting a little cold. So I'm going to head back. The marine biologists have got a bunch of work to do and they have a bunch of material, a bunch of crabs and it was a successful day. So I'm going to head back to UNB, and I'll see you guys later – bye! Hey guys, thanks for watching. I just wanted to explain a little bit more about marine biology which is one of the only programs of its kind in Canada. It is a four-year bachelor of science of program that can be completed at UNB Saint John, right on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. The marine semester, which we just joined is a 12-week semester program based out of Saint Andrews, with lots and lots of research and field work. we're very proud of this program at UNB and you can find out more about it at the link below. Also, check out the link below to enter our draw to win first-year tuition. Thanks for joining me today guys, see you next time!"
Aquaculture for Science Axolotl Biology Research,DxpQ2dJQGbU,BIO,"Hi this is Dr Jackson Gross.  The purpose of today's video,   a visit to the lab of Dr Crystal Rogers and  introduce you to the term scientific aquaculture,  which is the culture of aquatic organisms for  the advancement of knowledge. (off camera) Tell me why Axolotls are amazing one   more time. Okay axolotls are amazing because they  can regenerate almost every tissue in their body.   To date, there are studies that have shown they  can regrow their spinal cords after injury,   regrow limbs and pattern them normally. They  can regrow their eyes and brains and I focus on (laughing because of loud bird) I focus on understanding how they develop.  So i believe that the key to their   awesome capabilities as adults probably  lies in their embryonic programs.   Axolotls are considered neotenic animals which  means that they maintain their juvenile state   and as such they probably still express some of  their embryonic programs and so my lab focuses   on understanding the molecular mechanisms that  allow them to grow into these cool creatures. My lab has an adult axolotl colony where  we basically keep them and just use them   for breeding and then we do research on  their embryos. We do a lot of molecular biology.   We also study chicken and quail development and so  what we're really interested in is understanding   the evolution of development. So how do animals  make their faces. So if we look at the mechanisms   that drive the formation of the beak and face of  a chicken, compare that to the different molecular   signals that drive the face of a quail, and we  can compare that to axolotls who have really   soft squishy faces, we can really understand  the underpinnings of how the face is formed. Ours (Axolotls) are Leucistic. Which means that they're color colorless essentially but they're not   albino and then native axolotls are obviously  like a brown green sort of mud looking color   um and but there are there's a spectrum of  animals. So in the wild axolotls are almost extinct   they are a critically endangered population  and my lab is so lucky to have this colony   because not only do we get to experience them  they're just a joyous creature and they're really   adorable, very charismatic. But we don't know  how long they're going to last in the wild and   so it's really important this aquaculture that we do,  and that other labs do across the u.s and across   the world. It's really important that  somebody keeps the species alive   scientists have gone out to their  um native habitat in lake sochimilco   in near mexico city and they've tried to identify  active populations of these animals and they're   unable to find them which means that there  may not be a very large wild population.

Effective Teaching Strategies for Biology | TrinityX on edX | Course About Video,_bOH6xaVZLQ,BIO,"KATHLEEN ARCHER: Hi there, I'm Kathleen Archer, and I teach biology at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. I love teaching biology. There's just nothing better than working with students as they learn about the beauty and the complexity of living things. When I first started teaching, I had a lot of training in how to do research, and absolutely none in how to teach. That's still true for many faculty, and post-doctoral fellows, and grad students, even today. Fortunately, educational experts know a lot about what methods work well. And we'll take advantage of their work to emphasize teaching tools that are of demonstrated effectiveness and ease of use. In our course, you'll create learning outcomes, explore a variety of active learning strategies, and craft assessments for learning outcomes you desire. You'll work with other students in the course to apply these methods for a topic of biology of interest to you. Creating a successful learning experience for students makes working in the classroom a joy for me. And I think it will be a joy for you, too. I hope you'll join us for Effective Methods in Teaching College Biology."
Experience Changes Biology,HqKHDz7OBjI,BIO,"SUBJECT: So we've had this ongoing debate, right, nature versus nurture. And it asks the question are we pre-written beings, are we pre-determined beings, do our genetics dictate our fate, right, or are we made by our environment, are we molded by our experience, does language structure how we see the world, does culture dictate who we become, are we molded and shaped by the unfolding dynamics of interfacing with our environment? This is sometimes known as epigenetics, how literally things that happen to you during your formative years can transform how your genetic structure is expressed. Experience can change biology, OK. But recently this debate has taken on new heights because some of the new science-- there's an article called The Social Life of Genes that talked about this, which said that the idea of epigenetics actually goes much farther, and that experience throughout our lives affects our genetic expression. And the doctor, the researcher quoted in the piece, actually the best way to describe it. He basically says, that our cells, compose our bodies, are a technology for turning experience into biology, that even the cognitive framing that we give to an experience can change the physical expression of our cellular biology. So that consciousness itself, interpretation, storytelling, and framing, how we give meaning to our lives, can actually have a real effect at our genetic level, at the way our genetic software expresses itself. And we've always heard the bumper stickers that talk about the power of the mind, or the power of positive thinking, or the fact that we can shape our reality, but this notion not just effects genetic expression at one point in your life, but throughout your life, means that you're constantly composing your own biological unfolding. I design, therefore I become. I've said it before, I'll say it again, but we are as god's, my friends. And we might as well get good at it."
Biology at University of Northwestern,uIXZwJof4G8,BIO,"My background's in environmental science ecology. Specifically I have a lot of experience with aquatics, and so we do a lot of aquatic biology. So we're out on the lake, that's the nice thing about this campus, for the field stuff we have about 40 acres of woods. We have two lakes that we have lakeshore on. We have a stream that runs through campus, so my research focuses on the lakes and the stream. So we do some work with going out and taking samples, water quality samples out on the lake with kayaks and things. We have stream research where we're catching what we call macro-invertebrates, things that are small with no backbone but we can kind of tell a lot about what the water quality is like based on who lives in the water, and so my students go out take samples and then we bring them back to the lab and we analyze it, so it's kind of a marriage between the field and the laboratory. You know I see my job as imparting biological knowledge and book knowledge and things like that and skills scientific skills, but a lot of what I do is mentorship and it's helping them to discover who they are as individuals. What are their passions? What is their personality? What are their things that they're really interested in? And where is your calling to be a part of God's kingdom? You know, I've had conversations with people who have come and visited our institution and what they say is ""Wow, I mean, every person that we interact with shares the vision. Everybody, you know, is so warm, and everybody values what Northwestern is about."" We all kind of have the same DNA, in other words. That's rare."
Welcome to the Course - Introduction to the Biology of Cancer by Johns Hopkins University #1,aItslnKWGqc,BIO,"Welcome to Introduction to Cancer Biology. My name is Ken Pienta, Professor of Urology and Oncology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. I have been studying cancer and treating patients with cancer for over 25 years. Over 500,000 people in the United States and over 8 million people worldwide are dying from cancer every year. As people live longer, the incidence of cancer is rising worldwide and this disease is expected to strike over 20 million people annually by 2030. Everyone has been or will be touched by cancer in some way during their lifetime. Thanks to years of dedication and commitment to research we've made enormous advances in the prevention and treatment of cancer, but there is still a lot of work to be done. We've put together this course in order to introduce you to the essentials of cancer research. By the time you finish this course, you'll be able to identify the major types of cancer worldwide, including lung, colon, breast, prostate, liver and stomach cancers. List and describe the hallmarks of cancer. You'll be able to differentiate the contribution of genes to the risking growth of cancer. You'll be able to define metastasis and identify the major steps in the metastatic process. You will also be able to describe the role of imaging in the screening, diagnosis, staging and treatment of cancer. And finally, explain how cancer is treated. This introduction should be helpful to anyone who wants to develop a basic understand of cancer biology and treatment. It should be useful to undergraduate students who are interested in an introduction to the science of cancer. It should also be helpful to health care providers, data managers and educators who wish to develop a better understanding of cancer and how it affects individuals living in the US as well as other countries around the world. The course is not designed for patients seeking treatment guidance. But if you're interested in a career in cancer research or patient care, we hope this course will inspire you to pursue that path. Over the next few weeks, you'll be hearing from me and several of my colleagues. We'll walk you through the fundamental components of cancer biology research underway today. I'll start off by talking about the incidents and etiology of cancer. Next, Dr. Sarah Aman will cover the genetics of cancer. After that, we'll hear from Dr. Julian Zareef who will introduce you to the hallmarks of cancer. And next, we'll learn about metastasis from Dr. Ken Valkumberg. We'll then hear from Dianne Race in imaging diagnosis and staging of cancer. And finally, you'll hear from me again as I cover cancer treatment. I'm glad that you decided to join this course. We hope that you will develop a basic understanding of cancer. We hope that it will help you in whatever field you work in.

Why Do Leaves Change Colors in the Fall? | Biology for Kids | SciShow Kids,Xk4-6II8l5Q,BIO,"Hi guys! What’s it like outside this time of year where you live? In our part of the world, the days are getting shorter, and the weather’s getting cooler, and some of the leaves on the trees are starting to change colors. This might be happening where you live too — or it might be happening pretty soon. That’s because we’re heading into one of the most colorful times of year— autumn! Nothing says autumn or fall like lots of brightly colored leaves to rake and jump into, or just to pick up and admire. Now, some trees -- like pine trees, spruces and firs -- stay green all autumn and winter. But for many of the trees that have leaves, instead of pointy needles, this time of year means their leaves will turn different shades of red, orange, and yellow and eventually drop to the ground. Have you ever wondered why this happens? To find out, let’s take a close look at a green leaf. Leaves on most plants and trees are green because of a colorful chemical inside them called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is bright green. But it does more than just look pretty! It has a special job, because it’s able to capture the energy that’s in sunlight. Leaves use this light energy to make sugars, which the tree can then use for its own energy! So chlorophyll is what plants use to make their own food from sunlight! But! Chlorophyll isn’t the only thing in tree leaves that gives them color. Leaves have lots of other colorful chemicals -- called pigments -- inside them, that are red, yellow, orange, and even purple. If you’ve eaten carrots, cabbage, or cherries, then you’ve not only seen these pigments, you’ve had them for lunch! All of these colorful pigments have special jobs, but only chlorophyll helps a plant make the sugar that it needs to live. And since chlorophyll’s job is so important, there’s way more of it in green leaves than any of the other pigments. In fact, there’s so much chlorophyll that its green color covers up all of the other colors. Through spring and summer, we don’t see the red, yellow, and orange pigments in the leaves—we just see the green chlorophyll. But as summer starts to turn into fall, and the days get shorter, less and less sunlight hits the tree’s leaves ... ...so the tree starts to make less and less chlorophyll. Then the leaves become less green, and we’re able to see more of the other colors that were there all along! And when that starts to happen, you might want to take the time to enjoy these pretty leaves while you can … because not long after they turn color, they begin to fall! They fall because, without their chlorophyll to help them make energy, the leaves don’t really have a job to do. So as winter approaches, the energy that the leaves have made flows into the tree, and gets stashed away. Then, when the time is just right, they break off from the branches and fall to the ground. The tree can then live through the winter, using the energy that it’s saved up, until the days start to get longer and warmer. Then it grows new leaves to capture the sunlight… ...and the cycle starts all over again. So when you start to see yellow, orange and red leaves showing up where you live, remember, those colors were there are all along -- -- Autumn is just their time to shine! Thanks for joining me on SciShow Kids. What’s your favorite colored leaf? If you found an extra pretty one, get an adult to help you take a picture of it and send us an email at kids@scishow.com! And we’ll see you next time."
Average Andy Gives an Important Lesson About Biology,Lj70OfeglBs,BIO,"One more thing I wanted to-- Can we take a break and maybe do this after that? It seems like we've been going a while. Andy? Yeah. Shhh. OK. I just wonder if we should take a break here. I know schools are closed right now and parents are having to become teachers for their kids. I don't have kids of my own. That's why if these walls could talk they would say, thank you. But I want to help out as best I can. So I thought I would ask an outside expert to teach a lesson. The only person I have outside is Andy. He's going to be my expert. Andy, there's a lesson plan. There's an envelope I left outside this morning in the bushes kind of where you are. Keep going. There's a-- look for an envelope. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Careful for the snakes. I got it. There. All right. You're going to open that up. You're going to tell us what subject we'll be learning about today. Oh, God. Read it? Yep. Today's lesson will be about biology, specifically the human body. All right. And what makes you an expert on the human body? It's not a-- all right, just read. Just read? Yeah. The first part of the body I want to tell you about is the [LAUGHS] coccyx. The coccyx is a tiny little bone. This little bone is located at the bottom of your spine. You have two bursae. A bursa [LAUGHS] is a fatty sack. OK, very educational. That's good for the kids to know. Coccyx and a fatty sac. All right, what do you have next? Next, we have the ah-villa, which is-- No, no. --it's pronounced-- it says it-- uvula. Uvula. The uvula is a long [SIGHS]. The uvula is a long-- Uvula! --the uvula a lot is a long, fleshy organ that hangs down in the back of your mouth. [LAUGHTER] I'm going to pass out. Its name comes from the Latin word for grape. Some people say it looks like a tiny [LAUGHS] hanging ball. This cannot make it into the show. The uvula contains glands-- Uvula! --the uvula contains glands that secrete fluids that help-- I'm done-- lubrication. OK-- Please don't make me say it. --there's one more, I think. Please be the last thing. [DEEP BREATH] The last thing I want to tell you about is-- [LAUGHTER] --the last thing I want to tell you about is piloerection.

5 Tips for Writing an Extended Essay in Biology,2Ri9_ksuO0s,BIO,"today I'll be discussing five tips on how to write a successful IB extended essay in biology number one you need to choose the right topic and scope your essay needs to be beyond the scope of the IB curriculum but not so complicated that you won't be able to understand the concepts remember you're not expected to find anything groundbreaking but you also can't investigate something that a standard textbook and easily answer half of the battle is making sure your scope is neither too broad nor too specific 4,000 words isn't a lot when you want to write in detail and depth number two be organized but be realistic about your goals it might be helpful to create a timeline for example deciding on deadlines for finishing data collection finishing your intro when you need to hand in your first draft or your final draft number three keep it simple don't carry out extremely complicated experiments with lots of different variables and also mind the time how long will the experiments take including waiting time and repeats does anything need time to grow number four justify yourself where possible and within reason explain your decisions examiner's like to see that you have thought carefully not just about the how and the what but the why behind the process of answering your research question lastly mind your language don't use too much scientific jargon but be clear and specific don't be too wordy but be detailed it's a difficult balance to make but here you'll need to use your intuition does your essay read smoothly with someone be able to read through all four thousand words and one go and understand you we hope this video was useful best of luck with your extended essay"
Biology of the Eyes | Merck Manual Consumer Version,F3zwOFKc_gU,BIO,"The eyes are able to adjust the amount of light that enters, focus on objects, and instantly transmit images to the brain. Light enters the eye through the cornea which helps focus light on the retina at the back of the eye. Light then travels through the pupil. The iris is the colored area that surrounds the pupil which controls the amount of light that enters by constricting and dilating. Behind the iris sits the lens. The lens focuses light onto the retina by changing its shape, muscles attached to the lens cause it to become thicker to focus on nearby objects and thinner to focus on distant objects. The retina contains cells that sense light called photoreceptors and blood vessels to supply them. The nerve fibers from the photoreceptors are bundled together to form the optic nerve which carries signals to the brain. The fluid in the eye the aqueous humour nourishes the eye and maintains pressure. During glaucoma and imbalance between fluid production and drainage increases pressure and causes optical nerve damage that leads to loss of vision. The conjunctiva is the membrane that lines the white of the eye and the eyelid. Conjunctivitis occurs when this membrane becomes inflamed."
Marine Biologist: David Gruber | Best Job Ever,rThDFJFaRow,BIO,there's like world upon world upon worlds and each time we stumble upon them it's like indiana jones in the temple of doom and like uncovering this crypt that we've never seen before and suddenly we go down there and it's like wow [Music] i'm david gruber i'm a deep-sea marine biologist who's interested in all life in the ocean i want to understand it more and by understanding it i hope we can connect to it and ultimately protect it 4.6 billion years ago the earth forms and it didn't take that much time for the first life forms to come about those first kinds of cyanobacteria and we could basically make a tree and show how we're all related we all share dna we live on a place where the sun comes up and goes down but imagine you drop deep down underwater after a thousand meters you're living in an environment of perpetual darkness it is dark 24 7. and animals down there they have evolved mechanisms to give off light to communicate they're like hey i'm over here flash flasher hey i want to escape i'm going to give off a big burst of flashes to distract everybody so they've come up with lots of ways to use light and this has been going on for millions of years by going down there and studying things like tina fours comb jellies jellyfish copepods weird bioluminescent worms we can learn from them and then from that information we could then apply those genes to other cells and use that information in really cool ways whether you're a bacteria whether you're a worm whether you're an elephant we all share the same dna so our relationship to the ocean even though we came from lungfish from coelacanths and we're now going back in the water in really cool submarines we're still really new to the ocean 71 of our planet is covered in this big blue waterly beauty and it's filled with life as a marine biologist i'm dedicating my life to learning more about them and then finding out how they're related to us [Music] you
Introducing Communications Biology,ksg7OLIUod4,BIO,"The titles of our three new Communications journals reflect our position within the Nature Research family of journals. We launched the journals to fulfill a specific need for broad but selective open access journals for researchers who wish to publish in and are confident in quality of Nature Research journals. Our journals follow Nature Research best practice policies workflows and guidelines. We apply the same level of editorial rigor to our processes, but look for less broad interest and significance than the nature branded journals including Nature Communications. When I heard about the new journal and that it would be a broad scope biology open access journal I was really interested in getting in on sort of the ground floor of something and starting something new. But we're very different from the other Nature journals in that we are open access, we are online only and we do have working academics as part of our editorial board to help us to reach all of those subject areas within biology and to have the necessary breadth of expertise that we need within the journal. So in submission we are looking for a meaningful advance to specific fields which brings some biological insights at a higher level. Unlike other Nature branded journals, we do not require really broad readership or mechanistic details. We are aiming to achieve a fast, streamlined publication. I think we are different from other journals in that we really keep our authors' best interests in our heart. Once we are committed to certain manuscripts, we do our best to help the authors navigate the entire publication process. The aim of Communications Biology is to publish a wide range of biological research, so right now we're really excited about the diversity of topics that we've already covered in the articles that we've published so far and as well in the articles that we've got in the pipeline. So, we're looking at topics that range from neuroscience to ecology and evolution from biophysics to plants and we're just really looking to kind of keep that diversity going as we move forward. We apply slightly less stringent criteria than the other Nature journals, so if you were to submit your manuscript to for example Nature Communications it doesn't quite meet their editorial threshold, then Communications Biology would actually be a really great home for your article. Our editorial board members come from all over the world and from all its sub disciplines within biology. We're really excited to share Communications Biology with the world and I encourage anybody out there who wants to contribute to the journal just reach out to me if they have any questions"
WCSU: Biology Alive | 2022,E-T_ouBZ8m8,BIO,"At WestConn students can work on a variety of  research opportunities with faculty as mentors   from topics in genetics and neuroscience  to working with reptiles and amphibians and   arthropods like we do here in the field. Hi, I'm Neeta Connally. i am a medical entomologist and a professor in the department of Biology. I oversee the tickborne disease prevention laboratory where we conduct research studies trying to better understand tick-borne diseases   such as lyme disease. When I first came to WCSU I started working with Dr. Connally in her tick lab and I realized how much I loved field biology  and being outside and doing important stuff in science.  Every summer students help with  a variety of research activities conducted.   I was a summer research assistant in her lab so we  were just sampling the tick populations all over   Connecticut and I went through like all previous  ticket data and I'm writing a report kind of on   tick exposure and the risk of tick exposure in  residential areas.  Students here at WestConn have multiple research opportunities that range from  student independent study projects to advanced   senior research projects which are independently  mentored by professors. So in senior research this   semester we're investigating the blood-brain  barrier and how it can be manipulated through   the use of antibiotics. That can serve a whole  bunch of different functions considering how   leptin plays an important role in obesity and  how obesity can affect weapon resistance and   how that's tied to the blood brain barrier. As an  evolutionary biologist in my lab we study patterns   and processes in the evolution of major lineages  of calycerates specifically scorpions and spiders.   In the lab the students have the opportunity to  work with the next generation sequencing methods.   Since the results of these techniques requires  the use of programs written in Python and R   the students are learning these languages to come  up with their own scripts to analyze the data and   produce the results for their projects. We have  the opportunity to present our work at WestConn   Research Day in front of all of our colleagues  as well as other professionals in the field.   We have amazing professors. We have really small  classes so you're able to get one-on-one time   with your professors and ask any questions or  if you're confused go up to them and they're   always willing to help out. That's extremely  important because these letters of recommendation   and just having these references are huge for  getting positions you want in a scientific   view. This is a really great advantage when  you're conducting research because you can get   individualized attention. We really get to  know our students well and so we really get   to work closely with our biology majors.  And so every year I know that i get to put   together a team of undergrads who really  become very close and I get to know them   very well and I think both students and  the faculty benefit from those experiences."
What Are Chromosomes | Genetics | Biology | FuseSchool,Bgpq5ablvio,BIO,chromosomes in the nucleus of each eukaryotic cell the dna is packed together into chromosomes each chromosome is made up of dna that is tightly coiled around proteins that give it the structure this tight packaging system means that two meters worth of human dna can fit into a tiny cell that is only two micrometers wide in this video we are going to look at what chromosomes are and what their role is chromosomes usually occur in pairs except for gametes which are eggs and sperm cells but the number of chromosomes changes depending upon species humans have 23 pairs elephants have 28 pairs and carrot plants have nine pairs if you want to learn more about dna watch this video so chromosomes are made from long coiled molecules of dna known as double helix within this long chain there are shorter regions that carry the genetic code for particular proteins that are known as genes chromosomes carry all of the information that help a cell grow survive and reproduce each chromosome has a centromere which divides the chromosome into two sections or arms the location of the centromere on each chromosome is what gives it its characteristic shape the p arm are the short arms and the q arms are the long arm structure chromosomes are passed from parent to offspring and play an important role that ensures dna is copied and distributed accurately in the process of cell division chromosomes are not usually visible in the cell's nucleus and can only be seen when the cell is dividing during cell division the chromosomes are duplicated we will look at this in more detail in future videos such as what is mitosis when the chromosomes are duplicated they condense into short structures which can then be strained and observed under a microscope the centromere holds the duplicated chromosomes together duplicated chromosomes are commonly called sister chromatids so from this video you should know that chromosomes hold the dna inside the nucleus they have a centromere which holds the duplicate chromosomes together and these duplicates are known as chromatids humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes but other species have different amounts

Introduction to Middle school biology | Khan Academy,YyGwn3V6Rls,BIO,"- Hi everyone, Sal Khan here and welcome to Middle School Biology. I have Iman Howard here who manages our STEM content. Welcome Iman, and why should folks care about middle school biology? - Biology is the study of life, and so in this course it really answers why are things the way they are? Why do you look the way they do? Why do I look the way I do? And how every organism on earth has a really special purpose and a special trait, and based on these traits, it helps them interact with their environment. We even talk about energy, and energy can't be created and it can't be destroyed. It actually cycles as matter through an ecosystem. And it even has this really cool chemical reactions called photosynthesis where plants use light energy from the sun and they make their own food, which is insane. I think about organisms like the gorilla that are super big and strong, and they don't go and eat a cow. They go and eat plants because that's like getting energy right from the source. And then finally, we talk about evolution. Based on our traits, how have we changed over time? And how some of our natural traits were selected by the environment that create those changes. Or even how humans, we have something called artificial selection which explains why your dog's so cute, whether it's 100 pounds or five pounds, we did that. What do you think is cool about it, Sal? - Oh, well, you know, biology is trying to answer, I mean, to your point, the questions of life, which we still don't understand a lot about, but like what makes us us, and to realize that we don't exist as human beings in isolation, we're part of an ecosystem. We're part of a story, a narrative that's been going on for millions and billions of years. The fact that we're made up of trillions of cells, each of them with DNA that can describe who we are. How did all of this complexity come about? This is maybe the most mind-blowing topic that we're really at just the beginning of this journey. So I think folks are gonna be really, really excited, or it's gonna be really interesting to see all of the things that they get to learn. - Well, let's dig in."
Basic Molecular Biology: PCR and Real-Time PCR – Principle of PCR,db0HzFTJtCs,BIO,"Polymerase chain reaction or PCR  is a technique for amplifying   specific DNA fragments from a DNA template. PCR happens in three basic steps: denaturation,   annealing and extension. Denaturation is the first  step of PCR. In this step,   heat is applied to the template to separate  double-stranded DNA into two single strands. Following the denaturation step is  the annealing step. The temperature is   decreased so that the primers can anneal to the  complementary sequences on the DNA templates. The temperature of the annealing step depends  on the melting temperatures (Tm) of the primer. Selection of the annealing temperature  is critical. Typically the optimum   annealing temperature is 3-5 degrees  Celsius below the melting temperature. Too high of an annealing temperature  prevents optimal binding of the primers   to the templates while too low  of an annealing temperature   can lead to non-specific binding and,  subsequently, non-specific PCR products. Extension occurs after the primers hybridize  to the templates. The temperature of this step   is adjusted to the optimum temperature  where the DNA polymerase functions best. In extension, DNA polymerase  adds nucleotides to the 3’   ends of the primers that sit on the templates  following the base-pair complementarity rule. The length of the extension steps depends  on the extension rate of the polymerase used   and the length of the desired PCR product. These three steps comprise 1 PCR cycle.  The cycle is repeated multiple times   allowing generation of a large number  of copies of a specific DNA segment."
Biology - BS Program Overview &amp; Opportunities at NC State University,4E6wIaKobi8,BIO,"[ Music ] >> My biology degree, it set the foundation in a sense that it provided a framework of what I do now in biopharmaceuticals. Things that we learned about the human anatomy, about animal anatomy, it all comes into hand when you're training and teaching these professionals. And these are industries that are providing medicines for ailments of the body that otherwise wouldn't have a cure and so you have to know what it means to develop the medicine. You have to know how the body works and how cells work and how things work on a biological level. When I started my biological science program, the program actually allowed me to see plant models, animal models, and human models in some of the courses that I took. So it was great to get a perspective of the world from a leafy perspective to like a human perspective and that was not just in the courses that I took but also in the instructors I interacted with and in the lab. It was an all-encompassing experience for sure because it made me see more in the world. The biological science degree is essentially a springboard into other programs that are out there. Some people choose to continue their education, whether it be medical school or veterinary school. Essentially, biological sciences prepares you for any field that you're about to go into because of the critical thinking that it builds into your mind and you have to be a problem solver. You have to be a question asker when you enter any field such as medicine when you're diagnosing issues. Whether that be in, you know, animals or humans, you have to know the questions to ask to make the proper diagnoses which is the same even in pharmaceutical medicine as well. I think biological sciences is a great foundation for any field that you're looking to go to even if it's outside of medicine. I think you can use what you learn in the program to further you in any field that you might enter. [ Music ]"
GROTEK BIOLOGY SERIES – WORM CASTINGS,GWBy35AbWNQ,BIO,"A lot of our clients grow in containers or outside of true soil environment. I think there is a couple of interesting points here. One, I think we should talk about is the idea of what can be added to give basic biodiversity. A couple of things come to mind immediately, obviously compost that people can do themselves at home is a great way to get this, but there is also worm castings and insect frass that can both bring great opportunity as well. Yeah, and with thermophilic composting or hot composting, high temperature composting, there’s all types of organisms coming in from the environment during the composting process. And those composts are colonized with diverse biology actually after the composting process and during the maturation time, where you let that product stabilize and these things come in. They’re really going to be… What’s in there? We don’t really know. It’s going to be whatever is finding food in there, whatever the biology is in the surrounding environment. With Worm Castings, a lot of that biology is coming out of the gut of the worms who’s consuming these, as well as other organisms that could be attached to the feedstocks, like the food waste, the wood chips, whatever are used for… That’s the really interesting thing for me about worms and Worm Castings is that you are getting… it’s like a microbe factory. Like if 10 microbes go in the front end of a worm, 150 come out the back end. They are amazing things. You can definitely see why Darwin, basically after writing his first couple books, took the rest of his life to just study worms. They are fascinating little guys. Then we’ve got, like I’ve mentioned, something like insect frass as well. Which is similar, but has addition benefits sometimes to worm castings. Yeah, insect frass is neat and has some additional things to it as well. For people who don’t know, it is the manure from insects. So it’s also going to contain fragments of insects, exuded compounds, and including that is chitin, which is basically produced from the shells. Yeah and people will be familiar with this potentially from crab and lobster shells, using that in organic agriculture, but obviously insects, crustaceans, they technically fall into the same sort of family tree there, so it’s the same sort of thing. And chitin has some very interesting impacts in terms of what it provides to plants, not only the fact that it’s a polysaccharide, but it’s also got some sort of immune boosting properties to it as well. Super interesting. Yeah so you know insect frass is distinct from worm castings and to be honest, if someone can get a hold of the both of them and use them together, you’re going to get even more diversity."
Biology of SARS-CoV-2: Detection | HHMI BioInteractive Video,QqQL9uyThKw,BIO,"[BUGS CHIRPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] SPEAKER: There are several ways to test whether someone has been infected with SARS COV-2. Some tests can detect if you have an active infection or an infection that is happening right now. And others can detect if you've had an infection in the past and recovered. To determine whether you have an active infection, doctors can look for the presence of the virus in your body. One test uses RT-PCR, or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to look for pieces of the virus's RNA genome. A swab is taken of the inside of your nose or throat to collect cells or saliva in which the virus is likely replicating. If the virus's RNA is in your cells, it will be detected by the PCR test and give a positive test result. Another test for detecting an active infection looks for pieces of viral proteins recognized by the immune system, called antigens. If viral antigens are in your sample, they will be detected by the antigen test and give a positive result, but what if you've already recovered and no longer have the virus in your body? In this case, a blood sample is taken to test for the presence of specific types of antibodies that recognize the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by your body's immune system to fight off infections. Studying people who have antibodies to the virus can help scientists understand where a virus is spreading and how our immune system fights the virus. None of these tests are foolproof. Viral RNA, viral antigens, and antibodies are all produced at different times during an infection, and they won't always be detected. And some tests are also less sensitive than others, resulting in false negatives. Doctors may use a combination of tests or repeat tests at different times if they're uncertain. [MUSIC PLAYING]"
Biology Analogy vs Homology,VKEM4oFTU6Q,BIO,homology versus analogy now this is a very frequently asked question it's also something that students tend to struggle with a lot homologous structures versus analogous structures so homology and homologous structures what we're talking about is structures which share the same ancestry but II kind of different you know how they look in different functions so for instance here we have the wing of a bat and we also have the arm of a human both a human and a bat are mammals however the bat uses his wings to fly and the human uses his arms to not fly but you know for other things so this is what's called homology or homologous structures the wing of a bat in the arm of a human an analogy is something that's almost as a result of convergent evolution now if you remember what convergent evolution is that's two different lineages that seem to converge into one or one different trader or something for instance the wing of a bee and the wing of a bat a bat some mammal and a bee is an insect but they both have wings and they both function for flight however these are analogous structures analogous structures because they do not have a same common ancestor now another thing that I really want to mention quickly is that of vestigial structures now vestigial structures kind of almost that they arise from you know due to evolution due to not using a certain part of you know someone's body particular organ or a particular structure for long periods of time for instace we could say that the appendix is a vestigial organ you know in humans it doesn't really have a function I'm not sure really why I was there in the first place so weak also say that you know the hind legs of a whale are vestigial structures you know I bet you they know I had you know hiding behind legs but they do and you know they used to be terrestrial animals but then you know they just didn't have the use for the hind legs anymore but there are still you know these vestigial hind leg structures there
Every Biology Teacher Ever | @Aravind SA Stand-up Comedy | Amazon Prime Video,EtvEgbzIhts,BIO,"My biology teacher did not know how to start this class.

[BC]2 Basel Computational Biology Conference 2019: the movie,AkHoBF3ZmWs,BIO,"I'm very excited about the direction in which computational biology is developing. Everybody in the field realizes the enormous potential in this current amount of Big Data that is being generated now. SIB has been organizing [BC]2 since 2003. I came to attend this bioinformatics conference to update myself about the latest trends in this field. We're all still thinking about how to make the best of this data, how to harness its power. How do you get from complex multimodal patient data, to biomarkers that help predict if a patient has a high risk of getting a certain disease or not? It's important to have conferences which are multidisciplinary. We're not trying to just show our research and methods, we're also trying to understand what is the most important problem the other people are trying to solve. [BC]2 Conference is highly timely: it's really the future of medicine and digital health. Medicine that is going to be much more data-driven, predictive, personalized and proactive. Sitting in here you get like a first row seat to see a glimpse into the future. It's a really great place to meet people working in the field. I think there's also a big need in academia and the industry for this kind of work. We're very happy to provide, through SIB, [BC]2 as a platform to foster excellence in data science. The winner of the Early Career Bioinformatician Award: Eleonora Porcu. Today I received the Early Career Award for my work on Mendelian randomization approach integrating expression data with GWAS data. For me it's a huge honour receiving this award. Best Graduate Paper Award: Jochen Singer. I received the Best Graduate Paper Award for our work on the identification of mutations in single-cell datasets, which hopefully will help us to lead to new treatments for cancer in the near future. [BC]2 is the best meeting in Europe to get an overview of what's going on in computational biology."
Wildlife Biology at University of Montana - Dr. Erick Greene,u6uYdeNcxTo,BIO,"My name is Erick Greene.  I'm a faculty member in the Wildlife Biology Program at University of Montana. One of the very unique things about this wildlife biology program is that it is incredibly interdisciplinary. So this brings lots of different perspectives to the table. Just about all the faculty members in this program work at lots of different scales, from very local, to national, regional, and international. So for example, in my case, we're asking questions having to do with osprey conservation. And it turns out that they've got problems with mercury, for example, so where is the mercury coming from? How is it affecting organisms in the aquatic ecosystems, including ospreys? Clearly, our research on ospreys is important for humans as well. We've got some nest cameras up, and these have gone viral. There are people  all over the world watching these things, but we're also using these helicopters, little helicopters with cameras, to fly over the nest, so we can very quickly and safely figure out what is in the nests. My students and I are also very interested  in how animals communicate with each other. about danger, about predators.  It turns out that basically, lots of species, different species, they're all listening in on each other. So the chickadees understand what the robins are saying, the robins understand what the squirrels are saying,   and so forth. This is opening the world on stuff we had no idea of just a few years ago. I'd say that's fairly typical of this program. There's a wide range of the sort of questions people ask, ranging from very basic, just increasing knowledge about stuff we don't understand, about how the world works, to very applied, adressing very specific sorts of conservation issues that are imporatant locally, regionally, nationally, internationally. This is a fantastic place to be a student, to work, to come and live. The location is amazing.  Here we are in the heart of the Rockies, and so for the ecology classes I teach or animal behavior classes, or introductory biology classes, we've got this amazing natural laboratory, literally right out our back door. And we can be out watching bighorn sheep going through the motions of getting their  dominance hierarchy worked out, really close to bighorn sheep, hop in the van,   and we're back at school, so I mean there's probably -- I don't know of any  other schools in the world you can be this close to amazing wildlife and just natural conditions. It is so easy to get out the back door  and actually do real wildlife biology. And so for an undergrad there's a real rich opportunity to throw themselves into very interesting research and help out with it, or else develop it on their own, for a senior thesis or an honors thesis, but also get a lot of sort of one-on-one interactions with faculty members. And that doesn't happen at a lot of places."
What Are Trophic Levels? | Ecology &amp; Environment | Biology | FuseSchool,mCHdhXMFhcU,BIO,"A trophic level is a step in a food chain of an ecosystem. The organisms in a food chain are classified into their tropic level depending on their feeding behavior; the number of steps an organism is from the start of the chain is a measure of its trophic level. So the first trophic level is the primary producers, the organisms which produce their own food, usually the green plants or algae. These organisms are also referred to as autotrophs. From the producers, the second trophic level is the herbivores, the organisms that eat the plants. These organisms are called the primary consumers: they are the first step where nutrients are consumed. Level three is carnivores who eat herbivores, they are eating organisms from level two so they are the secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are followed by tertiary consumers. Level 4 is carnivores who eat other carnivores. Level 5 is the apex predators, the top of the food chain where the organisms isn’t eaten by other animals. Decomposers can also be considered to occupy their own trophic level. They break down dead animal and These categories are not strictly defined, as many organisms feed on several trophic levels; for example, some carnivores also consume plant materials. plant matter, also known as detritivores. Now let’s look at the tropic levels in this community: Level 1: Primary producers: Grass Level 2: Primary consumers: Rabbits Level 3: Secondary consumers: Fox Level 4: Tertiary consumer: Eagle Level 5: Decomposers: fungi So to summarise, trophic levels are the number of steps in an organisms is within a food chain. The first tophic level is usually the green plants, the producers, and as you go up a trophic level, and you go along a food chain of an ecosystem, you move on to the consumers, and finally the decomposers."
"What are Nerve Cells, Neurons &amp; Synapses? | Physiology | Biology | FuseSchool",n0Zc01e1Frw,BIO,from our introduction to the nervous system video you should already know that the nervous system is essentially a massive complex body-wide communication system messages are relayed to the central nervous system through sensory neurons so stimulus is detected by a receptor which sends the electrical impulse message along a sensory neuron to the central nervous system the central nervous system then relays the message via motor neurons to effectors which provide a response such as telling your legs to run in this video we are going to look at the nervous system in more detail including the different nerve cells and the structure to clarify nerve cells are known as neurons and they are three different types sensory intermediate or relay and motor neurons these specialized cells carry information as tiny electrical impulses and make up the nervous system sensory neurons carry signals from receptors to the spinal cord and brain intermediate or relay neurons carry messages from one part of the central nervous system to another the motor neurons carry signals from the central nervous system to effectors they all have three main components a cell body with a nucleus dendrons and dendrites which are the input of the neuron they receive information from other neurons or the external environment and transfer this information to the cell body and axons which carry the signal away from the cell body axons are surrounded by an insulating sheath which speeds up the rate of conduction it makes the nerve impulses travel faster because the sensory neurons are the ones that detect the stimulus they have receptors at the end of their fibers whereas because motor neurons trigger the reaction they have motor in plates which cause muscle fibers to contract or glands to secrete hormones the relay neurons make connections with other neurons across gaps that are called synapses so let's have a look at how synapses work synapses are a junction between two adjacent neurons and the electrical impulse has to cross the junction to carry on its journey the electrical impulse arrives along an axon this triggers the release of a chemical neurotransmitter which diffuses across the synapse and binds with the receptors on the membrane of the next neuron this stimulates the second neuron to generate a new electrical signal synapses not only connect two or more adjacent neurons together but they also allow the nerve signals to travel in one direction only and they also control the speed of the signal in another video we will look at reflex reactions and what happens when a very quick response is needed so from this video you should know that there are three different types of neuron or nerve cells the sensory neuron which detects the signal the relay or intermediate neuron and the motor neurons which trigger the response you should also know how synapses work transmitting the impulse between neurons

The  program as a whole offers so many diverse   looks into different areas of the field in  environmental biology. So you get a feel for   different kind of job titles that you're  going to be going into once you graduate.   One aspect of my education that I think really  helped me was, the hands-on learning such as my   invertebrate zoology class.

What Is A Niche? | Ecology &amp; Environment | Biology | FuseSchool,xIVixvcR4Jc,BIO,"what_is_a_niche? An ecological niche is a role an organism or population plays in an ecosystem Each species has a different set of adaptations and so they do not directly compete for all the same resources of the species. They have their own niche. So lots of different species can coexist because they occupy different niches. For example, some species may be able to live in a small range of temperatures,  while others might exist within a certain range of elevations or salinities. Rainforests provide a massive number of niches because of their immense diversity. The trend for most niches is related to Vertical Positioning in the forest. For example, some plants invest lots of energy into growing really tall. They spread out their branches and absorb light without competition. But their leaves are small, because the majority of energy is brought into growing upwards. Further down, the plants are every size, taking all the energy they can in order to compete with other plants. Then below the canopy, their is specialized plants, such as vines and carnivorous plants, such as the Pitcher plant. Each species responds differently to distribution of resources and competitors, til they each occupy their own niche. The canopy of the rainforest has provided the niche of the tree frog. Red eyed tree frogs live in tall trees. They lay eggs on leaves up in the trees, where the leaves overhang a pond, so that when the tadpoles hatch, they are washed into the water, where they must develop until they are ready to climb up trees. Red eyed tree frogs are permanently green to camouflage against leaves. for they have blue and orange features which are used for warning predators (Warning colouration). To understand what the niche of an organism is, you have to consider all the relationships that the organism with its environment, with other organisms, and the populations of it's environment."

What is Mitosis? | Genetics | Biology | FuseSchool,22V73bs4FAo,BIO,"Ever wish you could clone yourself? Ever wondered how you grow? In this video you are going to learn exactly how our bodies do this. Well, maybe not quite clone yourself exactly... But your cells do it all the time. There are two types of cell division: Mitosis and Meiosis. Mitosis produces identical copies of cells and is how most of our cells divide. Then there is Meiosis for our gametes, because they (gametes) are different. Remember that gametes only have 23 chromosomes rather than the normal 23 pairs. In this video we are going to learn all about mitosis: the process of cell cloning. But before we start, to make sure you're not in for a rocky ride, you need to know what all of these terms mean... Pause the video and have a look. Right so back to Mitosis. Mitosis produces identical copies of cells and is involved in Growth, Cell Repair and Asexual reproduction (which is how simple organisms reproduce). When cells divide by Mitosis the number of cells increases and hence the organism grows. So let's get stuck in All cells contain two sets of chromosomes So in humans we have two sets of 23 chromosomes, making 46 in total. But to keep this simple. We are just going to look at what happens to one of these pairs of chromosomes. Drawing our 23 pairs each time would make it very busy. These chromosomes are homologous. Which means they carry the same genes. But they may have different alleles, which are alternatives of the same genes. So the chromosome from your dad may carry the blue eye allele and the one from your mum may carry the green eye allele. The DNA is exactly replicated, and each chromosome now becomes two identical chromatids joined by the centromere. Chromatid is the word we use to describe the newly copied chromosome; the identical copies. The chromosomes become attached to Spindle Fibres which run from one pole to another. The individual chromosomes line up at the equator of the cell. The Spindle Fibres shorten, and the centromere divides. So each chromosome becomes two separate chromatids. The Cell Membrane pinches to separate the two sets of chromatids into two cells. So the original cell has become two daughter cells. The daughter cells are identical to one another, identical to the parent cell. And have the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. There is of course much more detail than this. But this is all we need to know for now. If you want to learn more just Google ""Mitosis"". Okay, so maybe you can't go out and clone yourself. But you do at least know how your cells managed to do it. From this video, you should now know that mitosis is how cells divide in order to grow and repair, or for asexual reproduction. When a cell divides by Mitosis, two new cells form and each cell is identical to the other, and also to the parent cell."
What is Synthetic Biology?,Fpkh4u-te60,BIO,"I was trained as a physicist, but fascinated with computers. After my PhD, I had my own individual aha moment of, what if we could program biology in much the same way that we do computers by using the rules of physics to do that? As a postdoctoral fellow, we were working on try to understand how the immune system works, and the field of synthetic biology was in its early stages. You could build a piece of DNA that when you stuck it into a bacterium would cause the bacterium to turn on and off in like a rhythmic blinking fashion. I think what's special about synthetic biology is, over the course of the last few decades, our ability to reprogram the living world has really accelerated. But then biological systems do so much more. What's so cool about biology is that it not only knows how to program, but then biological systems can make stuff like fuels and alcohols, medicines that we use like insulin, and laundry detergent enzymes. Synthetic biology is really about using biology's way of making molecules to make molecules biology never knew about. We've built a community here with many faculty, hundreds of students and researchers, that define us as the destination for work and research and study in synthetic biology. My lab focuses on the cell membrane, the structure that surrounds every single living organism. And what we are able to do is actually build the cell membrane in our laboratory from scratch. In my lab, one of the applications we're most interested in is using this idea of a cell based device to treat cancer by coaxing the immune system to recognize a tumor and remove it safely from the body. I have a brand new collaboration to use biology to help degrade plastics. We want to eventually be creating plastics that are degradable on command. We've been studying for a long time how molecules sense their environment. What we figured out how to do is take lead sensing molecules out of the bacteria and put them in a test tube. So now someone that wants to sense for lead can dip this piece of paper in the water and see the spot. I think we're kind of at this tipping point in the field of synthetic biology. It's going to impact us in our lifetime, right? And it's not going to be in 20 years or 40 years or 100 years but it's starting today."
"Quantitative Biology and Disease Modelling, DTU",6vylK_E2mvs,BIO,"My name is Mona Nourbakhsh. I am 23 years old and I'm studying Quantitative Biology and Disease Modeling. I think what is unique about this Master is that it's a collaboration between KU and DTU. It's about working at the interface between biology and computer science. And that's also what I'm very interested in, so it fits perfect. It seems like a great choice for me. Quantitative Biology and Disease Modeling is about developing computational and mathematical models, to analyze quantitative data. Currently we have a lot of data, but we need more ways to handle the data and analyze the data to hopefully contribute to improving our treatment of these diseases. I really like that DTU is one campus, so you really get this community feeling when you are walking on campus. I really like the atmosphere and the collaboration between students. I think the collaboration between students is really important because you don't feel alone. So for example, if you are having difficulty with a task or an assignment, you can always ask the others and then in this way work together. My dream job would be to work with personalized medicine and drug response profiles. So, I'm very interested in for example neurological diseases and cancer. Currently, the major treatments that we use for these diseases are not 100% effective since the individuals who have the diseases are of course are genetically different. So, it would be great if we could design a treatment for the specific person who has this disease."
Wildlife Biology at University of Montana - Dr. Lisa Eby,fnE0UnyfVYw,BIO,"My name is Lisa Eby and I'm an aquatic ecologist  at the University of Montana in the Wildlife Program. And a lot of what we focus on is native fish. One of the topics we're actually looking at is how life history changes, such as loss of  a migratory life history strategy, changes the ability of native populations to respond and stay connected on the landscape. So a lot of the small dams that  we've put on the landscape have isolated both cutthroat trout and bull trout, but if there are barriers to movement, then you're essentially keeping animals from being able to change their distribution. I got into science to do research,  but after interacting with students during my PhD and postdoc, I realized I really wanted to continue  to interact with students and teach. Part of my dissertation is sort of looking at the flipside of this isolation story. So, when we are  restoring streams, who is benefiting? So, are we benefiting our native fish?  Are increasing habitat for native fish? Or are we just increasing this connection  and potential for competition, or hybridization, or predation from non-native fish? Electrofishing is, in my opinion, one of the most fun aspects of field work. I like to think of it as a backcountry video game because it's very fast paced. It stuns them for just a few seconds  and we're able to net them out of the water and take a tissue sample from a fin that regenerates, and I'm able to take the back to the lab.  And so there's just a whole plethora of knowledge that you can gain from this genetic work. My research allows me to really work with managers and answer their questions, and help figure out what are the best strategies  for protecting our native species. A lot of questions and topics sort of surround where are the uncertainties in management. And so that allows us to work with managers. We work with Fish, Wildlife & Parks, we work with the Forest Service, and we work with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes a fair amount,  again trying to understand how their management actions or potential conservation strategies may play out in the long term for conservation of cutthroat. Even though the Wildlife Biology Program  is highly ranked across the nation, I think one of the things that makes students want to come here is the fact that it's in Montana. And you can do research right out your back door.  And from an undergraduate perspective, that makes it really nice  because we can incorporate this right into our classes and our teaching. We do a lot of field based labs and projects. They're great systems to work in and they are  just teaming with life, which a lot of people don't realize. There's a lot to appreciate about just sort of the way aquatic systems work, and what they do for us."
Fossils &amp; Evidence For Evolution | Evolution | Biology | FuseSchool,iYr3sYS9e0w,BIO,[Music] what is evolution and where is the supporting evidence for it the theory of evolution states that individuals within a species show a wide degree of variation and those individuals with characteristics best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce this theory grew from studying the variations and similarities in living animals and plants but also very importantly by studying fossils the study of the number and placement of fossils within certain types and areas of rock is known as the fossil record this record gives us an indication of the types of animals and plants that existed in the past for many millions of years ago right up until around 10 000 years ago fossils of single-celled organisms such as cyanobacteria from australia have been found in rocks that are more than 3.5 billion years old paleontologists are people who study fossils by comparing fossilized body structure and fossilized tracts of movement they painstakingly piece together the story of how animals and plants have changed and evolved over time importantly by comparing fossils from different species paleontologists can look for similarities in structure to try and work out which species are related to which others this work has enabled scientists to visualize how some species have evolved from others the discovery of transitional fossils has greatly assisted paleontologists understanding of how their evolutionary process occurred for example in 1988 scientists found a 370 million year old fossilized fish with a hand-like fin suggesting a transition from sea dwelling creature to land look at this picture of fish fingers meanwhile the discovery of transitional reptile fossils with mammal-like jawbones has enabled paleontologists to date the emergence of early mammals to about 245 million years ago mammals did therefore live alongside the dinosaurs the fossil record has enabled scientists to track the path of human evolution from great apes and has even allowed us to identify where humans and chimpanzees went their separate ways our last common ancestor lived about five to seven million years ago since that time over 20 hominin species have been discovered tracing the lineage of plant and animal species using fossil records is not an exact science the lack of transitional fossils makes this all the harder leading to significant gaps in the fossil record because the formation of fossils is a rare event many transitional species have just not formed fossils however as new fossils are being discovered all the time we can expect at least some of these gaps to eventually be filled in this video you have learned what the fossil record is and how it has contributed to our understanding of evolution you have also learnt about problems with the fossil record can you find any other examples online or in books of transitional fossils you
How Do Fossils Form | Evolution | Biology | FuseSchool,ID7qhn1ipmw,BIO,[Music] what is a fossil a fossil is the preserved remains or imprint in a rock of a plant or animal usually one that lived a long time ago many of the fossils discovered so far are ancestors of organisms living today while some fossils are the remains of organisms that still exist the study of fossils is called paleontology the total number of fossils and their placement within rocks is known as the fossil record much of what we understand about evolution comes from studying fossils so they are really important but how do they form when animals or plants die their remains usually decay to nothing it is only if the conditions are right that they can be preserved as fossils the best way to create a fossil is to trap and quickly bury a dead organism the dead remains of animals and plants that fall to the river or sea floors get covered in layers of sediment over time this sediment sinks as it is buried deeper by increasing layers meanwhile minerals permeate through the sediment and gradually recrystallise the non-decomposed remains this process is called per mineralization in some cases the whole skeleton eventually dissolves leaving a space in the sediment which becomes filled with mineral deposits in the exact shape of the original structure in this way a cast of the original structure is created eventually the pressure exerted on the lower layers of sediment is sufficient to turn it into rock millions of years later this rock may rise to the earth's surface where erosion and earthquakes eventually expose the fossil while whole body fossils can be created in this way and so can trace fossils trace fossils are the fossilized remains of things animals or plants have left behind this includes footprints tracks dung and even lightning strikes another way to create a fossil is by covering a specimen with a non-porous coating amber is the fossilized remains of sticky tree sap produced millions of years ago any insect or plant which was trapped in this tree sap would have become quickly coated and there would have been little opportunity for the remains to decay fossilized remains of plants and animals made in a similar way are sometimes found in peat bogs tar pits or ice so in this video you have learned what fossils and the fossil record are you have been shown different ways in which fossils are created and have seen the difference between body and trace fossils do you have any fossils or are there any fossils in the area where you live if you liked the video give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe comment below if you have any questions why not check out our few school app as well until next time

I love the ocean and I love fish and I love biology, so I was like it's everything I like wrapped into one, okay. The thing I was looking forward to the most traveling to Belize would have to be snorkeling and these amazing reefs that I saw on advertisements and movies and then just seeing it with my own two eyes and being able to study it and see everything just working in like unison and being able to identify and understand why it was happening, which is so amazing to me and I just want to go back. As a biology teacher, just as a biologist in general I would say that it's just a great experience. You are seeing a whole ecosystem that you cannot see in the Midwest. And it is the most diverse ecosystem in the northern hemisphere, possibly the world now. One memory I have from traveling to Belize was scuba diving, and all of a sudden like right behind me, this huge reef shark just pulls around and that was like one of the most amazing things. I was so excited like, I was hyperventilating. I was running out of air so quickly, like, that was awesome. I love every single person on this trip. They became my best friends. I realized how much I had in common with people, and that we really clicked and regardless of what situation you're in or they're in, you realize that on this trip you bond so much because you're with each other all week and you're having the time of your life and you're experiencing things that you may never get to experience again or depending on what you choose to do you can and these people are there for the ride. Even from things to like sitting in the boat not hesitating when it came to jumping off of it into the water, I mean it, just have to do it, and trying foods you just just do it and that that's my definite biggest take away for sure, and I'm going to apply it far beyond just this trip.

Structure Of The Leaf | Plant | Biology | The FuseSchool,co0JdqUlycg,BIO,"So we know that plants make their own food through photosynthesis. But how does a plant  get together the ingredients it needs for this: sunlight, carbon dioxide and water, and then combine them to create glucose and oxygen? Well, that's what leaves are for! The leaf is a plant's food factory—and its parts work together to get the reactants into one place so that photosynthesis can happen. Let's start with sunlight: Have a look at a leaf. The top of it is exposed to the most light—so the cells specialized for trapping light are on top. These cells are called palisade mesophyll and they're packed full of chlorophyll, the green chemical that plants use to absorb light. That's why the top side of the leaf is darker than the bottom side. Note that most leaves have a large surface area to trap as much sunlight as possible. What else do we need for photosynthesis? Carbon dioxide. That's where the bottom of the leaf comes in. It's got these little pores called stomata, which open up so carbon dioxide can diffuse in to the leaf. They're controlled by sausage shaped guard cells, which open up to let carbon dioxide in. But they can also close up the stomata and prevent other things like water from escaping. So the carbon dioxide comes in through the stomata, makes it's way through gaps in the airy layer of cells (called spongy mesophyll) at the bottom part of the leaf, heads up to the palisade layer for photosynthesis. Leaves are thin, so the carbon dioxide doesn't have very far to travel. So we've got sunlight and carbon dioxide now. What's left? Water. Water comes up through the roots and stem and enters the leaf through the vascular bundle, which contains a hollow tube for water transport called the Xylem. Look at how the vascular bundle spreads out in the leaf to form veins so it can spread water throughout the leaf. So now the leaf's palisade cells have water, carbon dioxide and sunlight, all they need to photosynthesise and make glucose (their food) and oxygen. But how does the leaf prevent unwanted intruders, like bacteria from getting in... and stop important reactants like water from escaping? Above the palisade mesophyll and below the spongy mesophyll are epidermis cells, which produce a waxy coating called the cuticle. The cuticle seals up the leaf, so the only way in and out is through the stomata, which are regulated by the guard cells. So let's go back through the parts of the leaf now, from top to bottom. We've got the thin, waxy cuticle... then the epidermis cells. These basically make up the leaf's skin. Then come the chlorophyll-rich palisade mesophyll, where the bulk of photosynthesis occurs. Below that is the spongy mesophyll, which have plenty space between them for reactants to move through. Through that space stretches the vascular bundle, with xylem to transport water and phloem to transport sugars. And below that, we've got another layer of epidermis and cuticle. Space around the lower epidermis and cuticle are the stomata, with guard cells on either side. Leaves come in all different shapes and sizes—look at a cabbage leaf... and an oak tree leaf. But most of them have these same parts in common which allows them to get their reactants in and perform photosynthesis."
Major Minute: Environmental Studies,arxBrlPNu-Q,ES,"(gentle music) - Hi, I'm Suzanne Crawford O'Brien, Chair of Native American and Indigenous Studies. - Hi, I'm Adela Ramos, Chair of Environmental Studies. - And hi, I'm Kevin O'Brien in the religion department. - [Group] And this is out Major Minute. (three beeps) - What does it take to understand climate change, or how human activity impacts geological formations, or how different cultural beliefs or political views shape our relationship to the earth. It takes interdisciplinary expertise and a robust place-based learning curriculum. These complex questions can't be answered by a single discipline or field. This is why, what makes our major unique in the region is in our last name. Studies. - Our interdisciplinary classes draw not only on many different perspectives but also on different parts of campus, to understand and to engage environmental challenges. You will wade into our local watershed, you'll analyze samples with a chemistry professor, make maps of the watershed with a geology professor, and reflect on the ethics of water with a philosophy professor. That kind of interdisciplinary work is essential for a healthy environment and for real environmental change. - Our commitment to place-based learning considers indigenous traditional ecological knowledge and how it should inform our approach to sustainability and environmental justice. Our campus is located on the traditional territories of the signatories of the Medicine Creek Tree, the Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Puyallup, and the Squaxon Island Nations. - This interdisciplinarity (laughs) - [Man Off Camera] That's okay. (everyone laughs) This interdisciplinarity distinguish our students and alumni from other candidates when applying for internships, graduate school and the job market. We're proud to see how they transform their passion for the environment into careers at national parks, state and federal environmental offices, in the healthcare and education sectors, AmeriCorps and other not-for-profit organizations."
Environmental Studies One Minute Major,dRWeUQTh8u8,ES,"(waves and sea gulls squawking) - Today's environmental challenges require an inter-disciplinary approach, so we help our students integrate perspectives and skills from sciences, social sciences, the arts and humanities in order to become effective change agents. We're located at the convergence of lots of different systems. Fields, forests, Chesapeake Bay, and within moments, we can step from the classroom into the field. - There's just no limit to what students can do because there's so many environmental issues that are facing the world and by giving them the skills to think critically about these issues and think creatively about these issues. They can take these skills into any career path that they want. - My favorite aspect of the environmental studies major was the fact that the major was so inter-disciplinary. I have primary interest in environmental sciences, however the major is designed for students to take classes outside of their concentrations. That sets me aside from other environmental scholars out there because no matter what your major is, you can have some sort of common ground or common interest in that. (upbeat music)"
Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies,qgjqz5ig99Y,ES,"The program is very flexible for the students. Students can really design their own program. Students can actually come in with the background that they have, figure out what their deficits are, what weaknesses they have, find the coursework that will help with that and then help them build from there into the areas that they are most interested in going out and working in. I'm doing a research together with UNICEF on their WASH programs. WASH is Water, Sanitation and Hygiene. So, we are trying to develop a sustainable financial model for making WASH successful in schools in developing countries. We have people, of course, from UNICEF who are participating with us on this research. We have some economists from Wharton school. We have students from different schools coming together with us. It's a very enriching experience to learn from people who have economic perspective on this issue. I really like my classmates in the MES program because they are coming from different backgrounds, and there are lots of international students, which is really amazing. Because when we study environmental issues, they have this global perspective in order to see what's going on around the world. They all come from these from professional backgrounds, from recent graduates, bachelor's degrees They all bring something completely different and everyone is really excited to share, and everyone is very open. So, we learn a lot from each other, and the classmates are really an amazing perk. The students in my concentration and certainly in the MES program have an opportunity to reach out and participate in a number of other CRO courses in different schools. They get involved in a number of different activities around the school that relate to sustainability. So there are a range of opportunities, I think, for our graduates to not just get a position, get a job, but also make a real contribution to how society then can evolve and move and be much more sustainable. Interdisciplinary work here at the MES program is in my opinion the best part of the program. It's part of why I came to this program, so I could explore some other areas. While I was here, I took classes in Negotiations and Conflict Resolution at Wharton. I took a Public International Law class at the Law School. Philadelphia is an awesome laboratory for students to work in. If you want to do policy, you can work with the government here in Philly. You can work on campus on sustainability projects. There are opportunities to get involved with ecology. Definitely come and see us! Meet our students, meet our faculty, come join one of the classes, come to one of our events, and really get to see the campus and the curriculum and what we do here. I think that there's something for everyone."
HFC Environmental Studies H264 1080p,gwP_N9foB3s,ES,"It covers basically anything that you have a question on about Environmental Science. from pollutants to the make up  of you know ecosystems it is just dealing with the environment. knowing how to treat it better, you know,  the river, the air. There's only a limited freshwater resource and if we keep polluting that well a lot of things can't be renewed. I actually would say the rouge river just, that's the main thing that I think about. you know it's something that actually shocked me and the things that you can do and  how it can easily be damaged. We need water to survive. There's also a lab for this course. a lot of science, a lot of math as well. chemistry labs, chemistry classes. I think it prepares you really well. it's very hands-on. It's very interesting. It's very fun. You do things that you never thought of doing. You know like, for example, finding the PH, the moisture of the soil. I'd say if you know you have  a small interest in science I feel like you'd really be interested in wanting to take more classes."
Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies,nFIuYL0Nr9M,ES,"Philadelphia is an awesome laboratory for students to work in. If you want to do policy, you can work with the government here in Philly. You can work on campus on sustainability projects. Green infrastructure is huge here in Philly. It's one of the, uh, big areas of study. We have the urban field station, which is the US Forest Service branch right here in the city. So, lots and lots of opportunities to work on campus, off campus with our partners on projects that might be independent studies, volunteer work, internships or, um, their capstone projects."
Purchase College Environmental Studies,PW5b-jggZkc,ES,"(happy and bright acoustic guitar music) - The way I go about preparing students is I try to demonstrate for them, by example. I mean I try to give them some time to experiment with it. So that when they get done, they don't just know facts, but they know how to get to the right answers. And that's far more important than just knowing the right answers. (happy and bright acoustic guitar music) - So all the ENV professors are like really, really hands on and like really always willing to go above and beyond for their students. They're always available, always open for any questions, any answers. Dr. Taylor literally went outside with me to help me with my senior project half and hour before he had a meeting in dress pants, dress shoes and a button up and trudged through the mud with me. So I can honestly say I do not think there's anything he would not do for his (laughs) students. - Our students are pretty awesome. And we have a really fairly small program, so we really get to know all of our students. I had a whole bunch come to Maine with me this past summer to do field work. We want to plan this garden that we're gonna plant, which is all them kind of outside of class time just being interested. Getting students out in the field and doing things outside and really engaging with what things look like in the real world. We try to get them doing a project that would be similar to what they would do in a masters program or in a Phd. So, it's intense. And we're really in vested in all of our students succeeding, so that's something that you're not gonna get at a huge school. And that you get here. (happy and bright acoustic guitar music)"

Graduate Studies in Environmental Studies,5pp_aPS58os,ES,"[ Music ] >> My experience as a graduate student at Queen's has been incredible. I've worked collaboratively with a variety of professors on campus, I've been fortunate enough to travel for field work internationally, so those experiences have been incredible. >> It's been really a very positive experience. It's a very tight-knit community, very supportive, and a lot of broad research areas that bolster your own research. >> We have research going on in the hard sciences, social sciences and studies, chemistry, biology, toxicology. We have projects in the humanities. We're joint with geology and geography. It's limitless, and that's one of the true benefits and powers of this school. >> Queen's School of Environmental Studies really offers students an opportunity to engage with like-minded individuals that are fully committed to environmental sustainability. We really appreciate working in multifaceted teams for research that is both theoretically grounded and empirically evidenced. So, what we're really wanting to do is ensure that environmental issues are seen from a big-picture perspective, and that we train our students around professional development skills that helps us translate that knowledge into the public, private, and community realms. >> Our graduate students have a variety of career paths they can choose from. We range from industry to government and non-government organizations. We have students go on to med school. We have students go on to work for Natural Resources Canada. It's not just academics that our students work on. There's really endless amounts of opportunity, and one of the best things about our program is that students can really get out what they put into it, and we're always sure not to limit their dreams or goals after their graduate studies. >> Graduate courses in this program are designed to challenge the way that you would normally think, so coming from my background, I had to really challenge my way of thinking, and fostering really critical thinking was really important in my education. >> I think one of the things that I value most about our school is the collaborative nature, and the open-door policy between students and professors. I've learnt so much through both formal and informal dialogue with professors in this school. [ Music ]"
Major Exploration: Environmental Studies at Amherst College,WfivxHpI9WQ,ES,"So my work is primarily focused on conservation of tropical forests, mainly in the Amazon basin. What I learned doing work with indigenous communities, with government actors, with scientists trying to advance conservation in tropical rainforests. Is that to do it successfully, you need to have a strong understanding of science, an understanding of society, of how people work, an understanding of politics. And it all needs to come together to make environmental progress. To make environmental policy that works for people and that works for the planet. In environmental studies I have taken classes in philosophy, sociology, history statistics, biology. As a geologist I have been able to teach a number of courses that deal with geologic time. That is the 4.5 billion years that the earth has been here. Those courses deal with the interplay of the climate over that period of time. But in environmental studies I'm able to take that one step further and deal with climate change in the ways that it is affecting humanity today and projecting those changes out into the future. Climate change, biodiversity conservation, marine management. All of these issues require students to be able to approach a problem from a variety of different disciplinary lenses. The Environmental Studies major starts out with training in subjects including history, statistics economics, political science and policy From there students take elective courses where they're able to follow along with a particular pathway of interest. Between the core requirements and the electives I get to choose, I can pursue any different avenue I want and and get a good mix of different classes So Environmental Studies pairs well with a lot of majors. It was flexible with my schedule. It was classes that were flexible with my interests. Get a taste for philosophy or or maybe even get some real-world application with statistics, all through the environmental lens. People I met in the intro classes and throughout like outing club and other extracurriculars on campus, who also happened to be majors. We would discuss stuff outside of class that was just of relevance to us. It felt more like a community than a lot of other majors who just took classes together. You going to also find a lot of different people, like even within the major. The diversity of students and like the perspectives they bring to the major is really cool. Whether you're interested in getting involved in policy, getting involved in doing cutting-edge ecological research that's gonna help us solve the climate crisis, whether you're interested in learning more about renewable energy. This is a place that can create opportunities for you, not just in the classroom but outside of it. I was really fortunate and lucky to have the opportunity to go to Ghana and to do research there on the ground understanding of what does the agricultural development strategy for Ghana look like. From a national level all the way down to the district in the village level and talking to people. I was really able to get it appreciation for what it is they're going through, how the project the agricultural development projects are helping them, what the shortcomings all the projects are. And that was cool because I can then marry that to what I did in the classroom in Global Environmental Politics whether it's going out into the field and doing work with communities, and there's opportunities to do that. Or going to more established policy think tanks over your summers to try to understand what it is that the most innovative people and thinkers are doing to try to confront climate change and develop renewable energy or protect threatened ecosystems. This is a place that can plug you in to these cutting-edge spaces for innovative thinking and action at the end of the day."

Intro to Environmental Science | DartmouthX on edX | Course About Video,2EYs7sUVyak,ES,"ANDY FRIEDLAND: In the 1960s, there were three billion people on earth. Today, there are 7.2 billion inhabitants impacting the natural world. We all require air, water, food, energy, and other resources. But people in different countries impact the environment in different ways. People in the developed world tend to use more fossil fuel energy and other resources that potentially cause greater harm to the natural environment. While the human population in the developed world has stopped growing, the population in the developing world continues to grow. Which environmental problems are real and which ones are blown out of proportion? Can we do anything as individuals to reduce environmental harm or is everything in the hands of governments and corporations? I'm Andy Friedland, Professor of Environmental Science at Dartmouth in Hanover, New Hampshire in the United States. Join me as we explore the field of environmental science and gain an understanding of human population dynamics, agriculture and soils, fossil fuel and renewable energies, and biodiversity and global change. We'll examine these and other issues and visit a variety of locations, where we will experience environmental science first hand. The course is introduction to environmental science.

Binghamton Major Minute - Environmental Studies,IkHdPiOe2rk,ES,"[Music] Hey. My name is Eliana Ebstein. I'm an Environmental Studies major. Today, I'm in the Greenhouse at Binghamton University. And, I'm going to tell you about my major in 60 seconds. So, when I was a freshman I was very confused about what I wanted to major in. I thought I maybe wanted to be in business school . . . It turns out I hated it. I found geography and through geography, I fell in love with environmental studies. My favorite class so far, has been ""Ecological Agriculture."". My professor has his own farm. So, he teaches us in a very hands-on approach. And, on Thursday, he's actually bringing in some worms. I could take home for my compost bin. Outside of class, I'm involved in Binghamton Food Rescue . . . which is an organization that reallocates food from supermarkets and farmers markets . . . to people in need within 24 hours. Also, next semester I'll be studying sustainability abroad, in Costa Rica . . . which I'm pretty excited about. Something that surprised me about this major was how well I can integrate it into my daily life. I changed the kinds of foods I eat and the activities I engage in. In 5-10 years, I see myself abroad with a Master's Degree in Public Administration . . . managing a nonprofit that utilizes recycled textiles. And, that is Environmental Studies in 60 seconds.  "
Environmental Studies at UVic,Wqi229BSOIw,ES,"Well I think what really sets apart in environmental studies is that there's a really strong focus on experiential learning. A lot of the instructors in the environmental studies department make a really strong effort to give their students a play-spaced education, where they're not just in the classroom, but they're studying in an outdoor environment. When you're talking about, you know, environmental issues, you really need to be out in the community, but also exploring the social and political, and even economic aspects of that, and trying to wrap that all together into an integrated lens. Our courses engage some of our primary environmental challenges, like climate change, and explore how we can solve some of these vaccine challenges. UVic has huge potential as a living classroom for learning about restoration and food systems. We have the legacies of different historical landscapes. We have Coastal Douglas-Fir forests. We have Garry oak meadow systems. And then we have all those spaces that come together to create this unique, patchy environment, where we can learn about different types of eco-systems. How they interact? What are the possibilities for each one? It's an awesome place to learn."
Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies Testimonial: Alison Fetterman,NlC7U1uGgLQ,ES,"My name is Alison Fetterman. My concentration is environmental biology. I have a bachelor’s degree in biology. After my bachelor’s, I went on to work. I worked at a bird observatory for about seven years, working on field studies with songbirds doing nest searching and banding and learning anything you can do in the field with birds. I wanted to move on further, so I looked into master's degrees and found that Penn was a good match with their field studies. I wanted field work. I wanted to work with birds. I wanted flexibility and so, this program checked all of the boxes and it has really... it's been amazing. The classmates is one of the big perks of this program. They all come from these, from professional backgrounds from recent graduates, bachelor's degrees. They all bring something completely different and everyone's really excited to share and everyone's very open. So, we learn a lot from each other and everyone is open about it and they want to learn from each other. So, the classmates are really an amazing perk."
Environmental Studies at Lewis &amp; Clark College,2wErZgu79B4,ES,"Environmental Studies is not a singular field. It is something that really is important in every single aspect of life. Beat that economics, beat that politics, beat that art or science being a part of ENVS is just a super amazing opportunity to pursue more dialogues where even though I'm communicating with someone who's completely different than me in viewpoint and stance I have the tools to have really productive and effective conversations where we both like come out having learned something. All of these really firmly held beliefs that lead to pretty kind of clear actions that we want to take might be and always are far more complex far more difficult in terms of solutions. I think like most people at Lewis & Clark you come into college thinking about how you can change the world, how you can make it a better place and I think environmental studies helps you really unpack what that means and how to accomplish your goals."

Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies: Why I Chose Penn,FkVppFjp5D0,ES,"Basically why I chose Penn was that you could actually tailor your own curriculum. If I wanted to do corporate sustainability, I don't have to limit myself to taking courses in biology or chemistry. I can actually take courses in law school or at business school or at public policy school. I chose this program because it's really a interdisciplinary program. It has different focuses, like sustainability, law, resource management, biology, maybe chemistry. So, I feel like for me to pursue a career in sustainability, I need to learn from all these fields. Interdisciplinary work, uh, here at the MES program is in my opinion the best part of the program. It's, it's part of why I came to this program, so I could explore, um, some other areas while I was here. I took classes in negotiations and conflict resolution at Wharton. I took a public international law class at the Law School. I actually didn't know I wanted to be a lawyer and wanted to attend law school before the MES program. I found out about the Penn program just searching online for master's programs. I wanted to go for a further degree. I wanted field work. I wanted to work with birds. I wanted flexibility. I needed, um, I wanted to be part-time. I wanted flexibility in my program to, um, to help me continue to raise my, my young family. So, this program checked all of the boxes."
Why I Chose Earth and Environmental Sciences,fd0jpf-X5Bs,ES,[Music] hi COS of 2024 I just wanted to say congratulations I'm accepting your offer to environmental sciences here at McMaster it is an amazing program one of the things I love about it is how close you get to the people in your program as well as the professors as well as the earth science one geo three labs they are so fun you get really hands-on in in the field and you guys are gonna rock it get it Rock fun anyways hi my name is Lucas and I'm a fourth year student and environmental sciences the reason I chose the master university is because of all the academic opportunities in class through school of Earth and environmental science has to offer the most exciting part happens through the hands-on field courses where your classroom can go from the standard style here in Hamilton to the aquatic caves of the Bahamas while you first-year students out there don't forget to have fun and good luck after completing the Gateway program you can apply into any level to science program including the three offered by the school of geography and earth sciences which can prepare you to meet the course requirements to be certified as a professional geoscientist in Ontario I chose the earth and environmental science program because I wanted to have the freedom of customizing my degree to fit my goals whether you love chemistry ecology and climate sciences or government policy making and the fight against climate change you'll find a world of opportunity which will allow you to explore incredible fields of study and prepare you for a truly engaging future broaden your perspective of the world with a tightly knit earth and environmental science community the small program size allows for no shortage of experiential education opportunities such as internships and co-ops and there are many courses and labs that will train you to address environmental challenges from an interdisciplinary perspective [Music]
Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies Testimonial: Tony Wang,GAXQC7wLjyQ,ES,"Hi! My name is Tony Wang. I’m in the MES program. My concentration is resource management. For my future career, I’m interested in sustainability. I believe in that innovation and technology are the future, so I want to do some kind of environmental consulting or environmental technology to solve some of the current environmental issues like resource management, water scarcity, like pollution, and also, like conflicts between human and wildlife. I really like my classmates in the MES program because they are coming from different backgrounds. And there are lots of international students, which is really amazing because when we study the environmental issues, we have this global perspective. We want to see what’s going on around the world. I would definitely say to study and to grow at the University of Pennsylvania, you definitely have to be open-minded to learn from your classmate, learn from your professors. And also you have to take the initiative to learn on your own, to study, to initiate your own independent project. That is kind of the way you are becoming more independent, innovative yourself. And you are carrying out what you’re learning into your career interests."
Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies: Meet the Students,GN882cirt8E,ES,"Um, I think the most exciting part of my job everyday is coming in and seeing what these students are going to do next. They're doing everything. They're so involved. They're so engaged and, uh, the professors are willing to work with them and say, you know, someone comes in with a crazy idea, you know, I want to go do this and we're like, ok, how can we make that happen? And, typically we can make it happen. And that's the really fun part about this job is finding out, oh so and so just did this, so and so just did that. They just came back from this project or that project and, um, the way that they engage with each other and interact with each other, um, on these projects has been phenomenal. So, uh, they're working with each other, they're working with professors, and they're just really, um, they're non-stop. It's hard to keep up with them. So, our class comprises of people from various backgrounds and from various countries. So, that itself is, uh, an experience where you learn from each other. Which, someone has done supply chain management, so you learn, you learn from them on certain aspects but you get stuck on doing your project or understanding some things. People coming from civil engineering background, people from, um, environmental studies core studies like geology. So, there's a lot to share. People from different areas, some have come from right out of the undergrad, some have 10 years of experience, some are still working, some, some with, some doing second master's. So, yeah it's been, it's been nice. But, but honestly, and I know it sounds cliché but the students are really the most phenomenal. Uh, it's an aspect of, uh, the community here. They come from all over the world, they come from all over the US and different experiences, different strengths, so I do feel extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity to teach here all these years."
Discover Natural Resources &amp; Environmental Sciences in ACES,ItYjgReNGZo,ES,"[Music] I started environmental science fully driven to law and policy. I thought for sure I was going to be an environmental lawyer, environmental law or education or somewhere in that realm, but one single experience switched it around for me and now I'm a fish biologist. I think NRES is a wonderfully collaborative and integrated department. I think there is a really wide diversity of what you can research, what you can learn about within one department, so of course if you're more interested in things below the soil, you can research that. If you're interested in things growing from the soil, you can research that. If you're interested in the animals and people that eat things that grow in the soil, you can research that as well. Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences some of the things that we focus on really involve water, soil, plants, animals, and people and all of those, and how they interact in the ecosystem. NRES to me just makes such a creative, curious person at the end of it because I learned stuff about soils. I learned stuff about aquatics, plants, birds, mammals a little bit of everything so like that really helped me be able to like challenge myself. We have world-class faculty that have done anything and everything you could possibly imagine and they're one of the biggest resources for our students. There's so many opportunities to get involved because the faculty is willing to work with a freshman and teach them because they want to help mentor. The teachers are some of the best people I've ever met in my life. NRES is literally a whole bunch of people who are super nerds and they do exactly what they love to do, that kind of leaks onto you and that kind of passion is very well reflected and it made it exciting in class every day for me. I think NRES would be for you if you really care about the environment. You really care about making an impact and a difference. What I know my students walk away with is a very well-rounded environmental education in all of the different disciplines that we offer. All of that is going to make you applicable for almost any job in regards to natural resources. I would love to be super contagious about the field of environmental science and natural resources. I would love to spread the word about how awesome it is to be sustainable and live a sustainable lifestyle to walk around proudly with your reusable metal straw and your reusable tupperware. If students ultimately want to change the world, I can't think of a better major to ultimately give you the direct skills to be able to do that. There's no one who is not rooting for you at the school. [Music]"
Environmental Sciences at USM,m29gIzk_USc,ES,"We're a department of environmental science and policy and so we offer two programs, one is Environmental Planning and Policy, the other is Environmental Science. and the premise is the people who go on to do planning and policy, need some basic environmental science, about which they're doing planning and policy and similarly the people who are studying environmental science, well, environmental science takes place in the real world, and most of it is done in consequence of policy; Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, hazardous waste. So we kind of marry both of those with the basic sciences. With biology and chemistry and geology things like that. Most of our students, one of the things they have in common is they like to be outside. another thing they tend to have in common, is they like to do things with their hands. - I had no idea I'd be interested in researching insects. I got into the department after taking the introductory environmental science course, my freshman year. And then my professor Dr. Staples hired me as a research associate. Where I started doing research with insects. The introduced pine sawfly lays its eggs on many different pine species, but in Maine primarily it defoliates eastern white pine. The larvae emerge from the eggs and start eating the needles. - I've learned a lot about insects which weren't necessarily what I had anticipated being interested in. I wasn't interested in that at all when I came here. I kind of stumbled into the program after taking the 101 course and immediately I know it's what I wanted to major in. I'm looking at the rates of parasitism of the introduced pine sawfly cocoons. To find out whether it's parasitized or not when the insect emerges, whether it's the pine sawfly or the parasitoid and the parasitoids emerge from much smaller holes and different species create different types of holes while they are emerging. -  When our students graduate and they enter the real world what they've done is they do not generally right term papers in this major. You write an assessment report, you write a land management plan, you write a soil analysis. So when they leave here, they leave here with a toolkit, a portfolio, of tangible products that they could show a prospective employer. And this also works fine for graduate school because doing practical things includes covering the theoretical. - As an undergraduate you really don't get to experience going to these conferences and I'm going to be going to my third conference which is just amazing. Getting to meet all these experts in the field and getting to make these connections I would never would have made before. - I haven't had any published papers yet but I learned very very quickly, how to write scientifically with being exposed to it and hopefully if everything goes well with this study and we get more data in the summer and might be able to publish this research. Which would be amazing"
Environmental Studies Class Attempts Sustainable Lifestyle,3Ho8GmsudQM,ES,"I aim to go zero-carbon, yes, but also zero-waste in the ground zero-pollution in the air, zero resources sucked from the Earth, zero toxins in the water. I didn't just want to have no carbon impact, I wanted to have no environmental impact. Okay? And that's what no impact is supposed to be about. Transportation... Food... Energy... We want to bring cloth napkins, so that we don't have all the paper waste, and we want to bring Tupperware for leftovers so you don't waste any food. And in the dining halls, don't get a lunch tray unless you absolutely have to, because that wastes a lot of water to wash it. If you could take the stairs, just do it, taking the elevator isn't going to help your health in any way and taking the stairs will energize you before class and it might be a pain if you're all the way up on the fourth floor, but it's four flights of stairs. You can do it. And I think one of the important things that you guys had, or at least said last week, was that if something is broken, try to fix it first. You know, if you have jeans with holes in them, maybe you can get them patched first before you decide to go out and buy, buy new jeans. This is a problem for a couple of reasons. I mean, it takes a while to get rid of Styrofoam, we know that. The other thing is: look how much space this takes up. So, if we take up a lot of space with this, it's not biodegradable, it's going to last for a long time, so let's try to avoid Styrofoam next week. This is what is in my toolkit for no-impact week. I've got my mug, that I use in the mornings, okay, Here's my plastic container which they mentioned, Here's my water bottle that I'll take around, Bryn mentioned cloth napkins, I've got two,  'cause I'm messy, I found out last year when I did no impact that I make a lot of mess, and I'm constantly using paper towels, so I have two this year. Hopefully that will get me through it. This is for my composting items, okay? So, if I go around- like this morning I had a banana peel, I'll keep it in here, and then again, we're going to do composting in the classroom."
The Environmental Studies Program at the Brock Environmental Center,-4XAUzxdc6I,ES,"This is the dawning of a new day for learning  in Virginia Beach City Public Schools.   The sand, the sun, the surf--it  redefines what a classroom can be.   Who needs walls when you have this space to learn.   Don't get me wrong, the Environmental  Studies Program has walls,   but instead of being connected to a school, we're  connected to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation's Brock Environmental Center. It is the  tenth Living Building in the world. This program has really helped me broaden  my sense of what I want to do with my life. To be able to have these opportunities, like  looking at this all, you wouldn't even think   it's a classroom, you know. And I really like  the emphasis on how it's not just in here, it's   everywhere, all your surroundings outside.  You've got the Bay right there. All the   wildlife from that, just hearing the sounds and  everything in the morning. It's so peaceful and   I'm really excited to be here, so. Here you get a chance to expand your horizons and   because students attend half day and  either the a.m. or the p.m. cohort,   you get a chance to collaborate with students  from around Virginia Beach, but also maintain   connections to your high school community,  your friends, your sports, and your clubs. I've never been so engaged in school,   and like, I get up to go to  school, which is like, rare for me. Sustainability and environmental  science are the heart of junior year.   Immersed in hands-on learning experiences  that are rooted in inquiry and curiosity,   students aren't just in the role of answering  questions they're posing them and conducting   authentic investigations to find answers with  creativity and innovation or learning by doing. I feel like it's still a great gateway to learn  how research works, uh, what a self-maintained   schedule and, uh, like work ethic is because I  feel like school does not set you up for that.   And cause like you have these assignments  to do in high school, but like in college   you have the same but like, you have so much  more freedom that it's really hard to take in.   I feel like getting this with internships in  the program itself is a really good preparation. Junior year is all about redefining what  a classroom can be. It's about breaking   boundaries and personalizing learning. About  seeking happiness and finding joy and adventure.   Senior year takes that a step further by  giving you the opportunity to personalize   an alternative classroom embedded in the  community. This is learning with meaning. This right here could be your classroom. go ahead  fill out the application and apply right now."
Overview of Environmental Studies 100,zOeVJQxM2Zc,ES,"Hello, I'm Catherine Walker and I'm going to talk with you a little bit about Environmental Studies 100. It's a course that covers the major causes and consequences of pollution, natural resource depletion, and the loss of biological diversity. The major objective is to develop a better understanding of our natural environment and the human impacts that degrade it. We also want to look at how we can take measures to protect and to restore environmental quality. The authors of our textbook, Miller and Spoolman, state that Environmental Science inspires and equips students to make a difference in this world. They emphasize natural capital, natural capital degradation, solutions, trade-offs, and the importance of individual actions. It is clear that humans have a definite roll in the health and sustainability of our natural environment. We are consumers of natural resources and we should protectors of our environment. By examining how nature works and how we interact with nature, we have a say, a stake in what the future holds. I hope this course does inspire you to be that protectorate of the environment and and I hope that we learn new ways to work together for a better future. Thank you."
Environmental Studies at Temple,fQ7UwfPjwKY,ES,"Environmental Studies is really focused on looking at the relationship between people and their environment, or humans and nature relations. Given the global environmental challenges, we really see this major as important for training students to address those challenges in a variety of fields, from academia to policy to advocacy. I chose Environmental Studies because out of my work with City Year through urban gardening and working with kids, I kind of became more passionate about environment issues but specifically in the city. You can understand the world in a better way than you ever would in any other major. Most of our classes are small. We spend a lot of time on advising and career preparation, finding internships for students. I’ve worked for the Office of Sustainability for the past three years as the outreach assistant there and I also helped start the Rad Dish Co-op, which is a student-run cooperative café on campus. There’s nothing like Rad Dish in Philadelphia at any other university. All of our food is sourced locally and seasonally. The idea for Rad Dish Co-op was completely student driven. They found me and then they took off. Our students are really passionate about making a difference in the world. They want to make the world a better place, but they want to get a job and a meaningful job that helps them to do that. And our students do that. We provide the skills and training necessary. With the GIS Certificate and a lot of the stuff offered in the department, you can have that opportunity to learn what you need to do to make cities greener. I definitely feel confident coming out that I could go work in the city and make it awesome."
Environmental Studies Course Puts Students to Work in the Field,GaJeBtQjo_w,ES,"[Music plays] So the specific research that I'm doing, I'm gonna be working on the soil composition to find out what will grow best here, and we also wanted to find out what's growing now, was the goal. So we came out and we did a survey of the area, and we counted plants to see what's growing now and how we can help other things that are native grow here too. We're working with the Boise River Enhancement Network and the City of Boise to help rehabilitate a 12-acre hillside of the Hyatt Hidden Wetlands Reserve here in Boise. It's a hillside that's just completely overgrown with invasive species, and we'd like to see it have more native bunchgrasses and annual forbs. We're really trying to show the value of wetlands, especially in urban settings like here in Boise, so what part of my research is is to collect air particulate samples throughout this 44-acre site and then compare them to other sites down the road and I want to use those particulates, see what the pollutants are, and kind of show that they are improving air quality and we should really care about wetlands and care about improving our environment by wetlands. What we're working on is measuring air quality levels around Boise and comparing them to a stationary monitor that's located in Meridian. And what we're kind of doing is we're looking at how air quality varies over a wide spacial area, as compared to just a single stationary monitor. So, greenbelt, obviously, the levels are much better than you'll see downtown. Downtown it tends to spike around rush hour, major intersections like Front and Capitol Street. Over here the air quality's a lot better, I would say. The intent of the research is to kind of see how the particulate matter and the air quality changes basically over really short distance. We're finding that there is, depending on time of day and what block you're on, there can be huge disparities, sometimes hundreds of times greater particulate matter 2.5 in the air from block to block, which is really interesting. So far that's a lot different from what I expected. That thing that I really want to find out is just how big of a difference there is between traveling on the greenbelt, like coming in downtown, because that way sensitive populations, it's nice to know if somebody wants to bike to work, what is the best, healthiest way for them to be getting to work, getting around where they need to go. We don't have enough information to say anything definitively yet, but once a year has rolled around, we can make some assumptions about how things change seasonally. [Music plays and fades out]"
Study Environmental Sciences at the University of Birmingham,G8pFroRdMEM,ES,[Music] an environmental sciences degree from the University of Birmingham will give you the knowledge and the skills to understand and solve the world's most pressing environmental problems finding answers to real-world problems will make you highly employable they have multiple opportunities to help improve your employability for example you can take final year placements in a range of organizations including businesses charities and governmental organisations the structure of the course is very adaptable in the first year you'll take all core subjects and these will give you the core skills in environmental science which includes field techniques but also programming and other ways to use a computer to help you solve problems in the second and third years you can choose much more of what you want to do in particular there are three main themes firstly there's environmental risks secondly there's at the global environment and thirdly there's the living planet so you can choose the stream that's right for you so not only will you work on things that really interest you but you'll also be able to tailor your CV to the jobs that you want we have a wide range of field courses with which to take your learning outside the laboratory and the lecture hall for example you might study pollution mediated ecology in Switzerland or in your final year you might go to Delhi to look at the chronic air pollution there or you might go to China to look at water science you'll be taught by world leading academics using state-of-the-art facilities including the new collaborative teaching lab you'll also have the chance to work with these academics and help them with their research the research in the school spans all seven continents so for example you could help me with my work on air pollution in East Africa or in India or more close to home we could look at air pollution in the West Midlands or within Birmingham you could look at forest ecology and the effects of climate change on forests by using our new woodland to the north for Birmingham this woodland is being pumped full of carbon dioxide to see what the effects of climate change will be in the 50 years time we also have world leading research facilities and nanoparticles water science and air pollution so together with the rest of the environmental sciences team I look forward to working into the University of Birmingham you [Music] you
Environmental Studies at Lewis &amp; Clark is Unique,BiP2O233vwA,ES,"Hi there I'm Jim Proctor I'm a  geographer and I'm Professor and   Director of the Environmental Studies  program at Lewis & Clark College.   I'd like to name four things that make our program  distinct, they all start with the letter I. First we are highly interdisciplinary, our major  draws upon fully eleven contributing departments   across the natural sciences, social sciences and  humanities, and my colleagues Jessica Kleiss, Liz   Safran, and I help you weave together the concepts  and skills that you learn in those courses. Second, we are highly international, drawing  upon our international campus community   and our acclaimed overseas and off-campus  programs. Yes ours is a green campus,   but we want you to experience this big  world and we give you opportunity to do so.   And then to bring home those experiences to  inspire your work in Environmental Studies. Third, we're highly innovative. We don't believe  that you will be able to successfully address   the environmental issues you  will face today and tomorrow   with the approaches of yesterday. And  so we will challenge you to cultivate   new concepts and new skills to address the  issues that you will face in your lifetimes. Finally we're highly individualized. We  give you the opportunity to pursue a custom   area of interest in our environmental studies  major, this is an area of passion and expertise   you wish to develop upon which you will do  a capstone exercise in your senior year. So those are the four things- we are highly  interdisciplinary, international, innovative, and   individualized. Come check us out! And feel  free to be in touch. Thank you so much, bye bye."
Why Environmental Studies?,ZyPgJQAUA6o,ES,"Since I was a little kid I always loved animals and it always felt that it was important to protect the environment. Working for Lush and working on issues like the tar sands and having dirty oil, stopping dirty oil from coming to the European Union while I was there and campaigning against that.  With the inherently green environment of, you know, the Dutch atmosphere is what really inspired me to work towards, you know, greening my own life and focusing on an environmental future.  One, I wanted a theory based program but I also wanted the experience - that hands-on experience. I also liked the close-knit community that was in the Environmental Studies faculty I really wanted that and also the professors they're experts in their field and I wanted to learn from the best. I had a sort of careers appointment with York to try to figure out what was best for me and after explaining how much I loved the environment and I love working with animals or with nature in general they thought that FES would be perfect to me so I'm extremely lucky because this is all I applied for, this is the only university I chose, and I managed to get in and it's just been perfect ever since day one."
Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies Testimonial: David Groff,ggHSPSdnyD8,ES,"My name's David Groff. I'm a part-time MES student here at the University of Pennsylvania. I am getting my Master of Environmental Studies in environmental biology and I'm an employee at the University of Pennsylvania as well. A lot of the programs have field trips, which is wonderful because you actually get to go out hands-on and actually see what you're working with instead of sitting in a classroom looking at a slide. I've gone to Puerto Rico for a class, Puerto Rico Field Ecology, and learned about the four different major ecosystems down there and how they're all impacted by development, climate change and tourism. If you have a chance to take them, take as many different field classes as you can. Getting out there and seeing the different aspects from a wetlands site and then going back to the same spot later and seeing it from an ornithology site as two different comparisons is absolutely amazing."
What’s the difference between Environmental Science and programs in the Faculty of Environment?,wdq30WnbP-E,ES,all right what was the line again so more enthusiasm get fired up evan let's go hi i'm evan and i'm graham and today we're here to talk about the differences between environmental science and the programs in the faculty of environment you can think of environmental science as the study between both the living and non-living parts of the environment and how they work together as a system this involves a study of biology chemistry and earth science and using that we can look at how the world was in the past how it works in the present and how it might change in the future programs in the faculty of environment look at various human and social factors as well as the science involved with environment and sustainability and this includes examining weather patterns looking at climate change geography resource management sustainability practices as well as even evaluating access to clean drinking water so overall you can think of environmental science as a pure science meanwhile the programs in the faculty of environment look at the societal and human impacts however there is a lot of overlap including labs oh yeah and you'll definitely get a chance to dive into these topics during labs in the end what's important is finding out what your interests are and picking the right program for you we recommend that you check out our environmental degree programs page online to learn more about all of our environmental programs at waterloo including co-op and career opportunities to really allow you to differentiate between our programs thanks for joining us [Music] i did i clearly hadn't practiced that part before
Studying Environmental Science at the University of Arizona,HiC1lMiOAAw,ES,"I didn't know what I wanted to do out of high school. And so for a few years, I just messed around, not really driven to do anything. But I knew I wanted to do something, and I always flirted with environmental science. It's a big motivator to protect our environment and help keep our water clean. Getting outside of the lab or getting outside of an office, and getting into the field and seeing the wetlands here at Sweetwater, seeing the trees, seeing the birds, sometimes seeing a rattlesnake, it can be pretty fun. This has definitely been a pivotal point in my life. Having the opportunity to study at the University of Arizona, be able to contribute, that's been a lifelong dream."
50 Years of Environmental Sciences at UEA | University of East Anglia (UEA),3UsQbVj531g,ES,[Music] but school was established in 1967 and in that time there's 50 years the school has very much contributed to the whole development of the discipline of the environmental sciences and we particularly from you know the the word go took an interdisciplinary approach so one of the great things about the school is the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration I don't think a lot of the work on the national ecosystem assessment and everything that's followed from it would have happened if we'd not have geographers and economists working in such close proximity another example is the way in which some of our social scientists have worked with earth scientists interested in volcanic hazards within the school of environmental sciences we have a very strong theme in natural hazards in particular our Volcanology group have been involved in large projects which interact with local communities that might be impacted by volcanic activity climate change is an area of research that has changed fundamentally in the 50 years since the school of Environmental Sciences began here at UVA 50 years ago climate change is thoughtful or something that changes on geological timescales tens of thousands to many millions of years now it's been firmly established that climate changes on timescales affect individual human lives and research here at URI a has established those changes and also the principal causes of them the Tyndall centre is a network of universities in the UK with the headquarter its headquarter at au Yale and we're thinking here about getting society and people to use less energy or energy more smartly or to switch to renewable energy which is really critical in terms of addressing an issue like climate change the international policy response to the global warming problem has been to establish the limits of supposedly safe global warming there at URI a were very proud of the fact that our global temperature record has been used to monitor global warming as approaches these limits of one and a half to two degrees Celsius so one of the things I most love about teaching here in the school of environmental sciences is taking our students out on field courses we're very committed to getting students out of the classroom and into the field and teaching them real practical skills for collecting data making observations and learning how to do analysis very exciting for me as the head of school at this time to see this your breadth and depth of research and teaching activity I'm very proud of that opportunity to hit the school particularly in this year when we've been awarded the Queen's anniversary prize for further in higher education that's a great accolade and one that recognizes these 50 years of endeavor in developing and promoting environmental science and translating our search into doing something better for the environment in terms of protecting the environment for future generations are great accolade and one that is very much well earned as the school the staff the students of this 50 years have made a real big impact and we can see that both internationally nationally and locally so we look forward to continuing that great effort in the next 50 years [Music]

Environmental Studies - A Global Perspective | CurtinX on edX,rAcgOGQv8Sw,ES,"PROF BALSER>> Those of us who are alive today were born into a world that is changing faster and facing more challenges than at any other time in history. There are those who say the problems can't be fixed. But some of us know better. We know it can be turned around. But it will take the efforts of all of us - spanning areas like science, technology, arts, policy, law, even philosophy … crossing international boundaries and cultural divides. It may seem daunting – but it can be done. Every day, all around us, people are changing the world. This course is a chance to join with a community of people all around the world that want to help solve the problems. In it you're going to have a chance to learn some the basics about Environmental Studies that we need to know in order to address the challenges that we face. A little knowledge really can go a long way, so if you're interested in making a difference, I invite you to join us and help make the world a better place."
"Michelle Wunderley, Point Park alumna of the M.S. in environmental studies program",ZSanicWrDzE,ES,">> Michelle Wunderley I'm Michelle Wunderley and I work for Enercon  Services Incorporated out of the Murrysville  office and I am a Point Park Alum. First, it was an accelerated program. I just finished  up school so year long was extremely appealing to me. The Environmental Law and Environmental Policy class really  stuck out to me that a lot of other programs didn't have. This degree has really helped me because it taught me  the regulations and laws that I need to use during my job,  so the Environmental Law and Environmental Policy  class have really helped me quite a bit. This career path is extremely relevant because it's such  a hot topic with drilling, climate change, air quality  issues from the past, steel mills, things of those nature.  If you're enjoying science, it's a great way to jump in."
Laurier Arts: Geography and Environmental Studies,F8PaZ_uzRPs,ES,"it really is one of those touch stone of what it means to be Canadian. The whole mythology of Wayne Gretzky learning on the backyard rink that his dad built for him and it's just I think something that Canadians do and cherish very much. You know flooding the backyard going for skate is a great way to, to spend the winter. The fact that people can you something that they're passionate about like outdoor rinks and contribute to a scientific project, I think that people find that very exciting and interesting to be apart of. We're born scientists and there's no reason that it shouldn't be a normal part of our life and that we shouldn't enjoy it. Rink Watch is a pretty simple website to navigate if you have a rink in your neighborhood, an outdoor rink that you skate on regularly, pin its location on our interactive map and then come back on a regular basis and report if you can skate or not based on the weather conditions. people might be a little bit surprised at a project like bring watch would come a Faculty of Arts. We've made environmental researcher priority here so that we're contributing to the broader conversation in Canada and internationally about how the natural environment is important to our quality of life and how some other things that we're doing have impacts on the natural environment as well. The great thing about citizen size for data collection is that we have a wider reach and we have more people involved and we have more data volume. For a given area we may have one weather station at the airport but we may have 500 rinks and so the very fine scale spatial resolution variation in temperature is where we can start to resolve by using this rink data. We see this as a starting point and not as a finishing point and so in the coming years here at the Laurier Faculty of Arts and in the Department of Geography environmental studies what we want to do is to build an ethos across Canada and across North America that all of us are scientists we all need to pull together"
Meet Rachel – Environmental Studies Major at Salisbury University,xj7hCjncf18,ES," My major here at Salisbury is environmental studies. After taking an environmental science course in high school, I realized that I really had a passion for environmental issues and decided SU was the perfect place to study the environment. The environmental studies department, as an interdisciplinary program, really stood out to me as different from among the other schools I was considering. The department really does a great job of connecting students with their professors. And not only are they your professors, but they're your mentors and almost your peers in a sense too. I see that our major is really kind of like a small family of people. We just enjoy spending time together, from going on camping trips at Assateague to taking trips together downtown to Third Friday. The students and professors are just always looking for ways to interact and get to know one another. One of the great benefits of environmental studies at SU is that it's environmental studies and not environmental science, meaning that we cover a variety of disciplines within our program requirements. So not only do we talk about the natural sciences and the physical sciences, such biology, chemistry, and geography, but we also talk about the humanities and we take courses in philosophy, in art, in history. And so all of those courses are focused on the environment. But at the same time, we graduate with this broad understanding of environmental issues. And it really is a program that allows students to develop your individual interests. One of the things that's really unique to the environmental studies program is the senior seminar capstone project. My class right now is working on a project focused on climate change. And we've decided to look at how climate change is specifically impacting Wicomico County. Sometimes in environmental studies, you get the feeling of being bogged down. And you learn about everything humans are doing to harm the environment. And you're just like, oh, gosh. What can I do to help? And this class gives you that sense of almost forcing us in a way to get to know our community and meet with people, meet with community members, or the mayor. One class is doing something with the city of Berlin. It gives us this sense of empowerment-- that you leave with this uplifting feeling that you can really make a difference in the world.

Environmental Studies at Austin College,9Fwyr8ddjaM,ES,"So my name is Peter Schulze and my field is Ecology, or the study of ecosystems primarily,  and I've been at Austin College since the late 1990's.  Faculty from all over the college are involved in  the Environmental Studies program and  students who major or minor in Environmental Studies take courses from a wide range of faculty--  Some who are environmental specialists  and others who teach very closely related courses like Environmental Economics or Environmental Ethics.  Some do a lot of Field Biology,  some do more Political Science-type things,  and we even have people who combine Environmental Studies with  Art and all kinds of other fields.  I think one of the things that gets students most excited  right off the bat is our courses are not solely about science.  They definitely have heavy science content,  but our program is Environmental Studies. And so the courses also involve social science issues like Economics and issues from all across the campus,  such as ethics questions that are taught by Philosophers.   Once they get into upper-level courses,  then there's all kinds of opportunity to actually,  not just study the subject, but  do something.  So, for example,  students who take a course called Environmental Solutions propose ways to reduce the college's environmental impact.   And over the years, the college has adopted  more than 30 of these proposals that started  as students' projects. I think the hallmarks of the program are getting students actually involved  and actually doing something.  We've created opportunities that students have taken  to get their feet wet... but not always literally.  So sometimes it's in Field Biology,  but other times its finding ways to reduce  the green house gas emissions of the college. Or it may be through a summer internship.  We have exclusive arrangements with  three world-class organizations that work on different subjects  that have internships that are only available to Austin College students.  The Sneed Prairie Project is one of my favorite things  about our program.  It may sound strange to set fires for the sake of an ecosystem, but Austin College is in what's called a  Tall Grass Prairie Biome. The Prairie Biome was maintained by  two natural processes: Herds of bison trampling plants  and fires that burned plants.  The biome has almost completely been eliminated by urban development and agriculture, and so we're trying to restore a little bit of it.  And the fires actually happen to be one of the most powerful tools available. Our students tend to go into any of four areas once they graduate.  Some go to graduate school right away,  but others go to work right away.  And one of the surprises about Environmental Studies is  they're not out there wondering if they're ever going to find a job.  Our students don't tend to be struggling to find jobs. Some of them go to work for  companies as Environmental Specialists. Others work for non-profit organizations,  maybe in advocacy  or in some sort of Environmental Justice work, for example.  And others work for the government, whether it's  a federal government or a state government  or a city government.  You should consider studying the environment at Austin College  because we'll give you the opportunities to  start making a difference while you're here,  and the skills and abilities and experience that you need  to go make an even bigger difference after you graduate."

Studying Environmental Science at Sheffield,aVNkLBoPH9k,ES,"I chose to study Environmental Science because it was a blend of my two favourite subjects, which were Geography and Biology and I feel like it just crossed across those subjects really well. I now work at JBA Consulting as an assistant analyst. I definitely enjoyed the wide variety and the flexibility as well so you could choose various different modules to really study what you had a passion for and what you were particularly interested in. I enjoyed the fieldwork most, I think. Being able to get out in the field and also being able to study with other courses and being able to share our knowledge. So I've got friends who are zoologists, I've got botanist friends, geographers, so it's really nice to spread the information and share our gained knowledge. I'm just about to start a new job in two days' time at AST I'm going to be the carbon dating manager. Specifically for the course, the advice I'd give would be speak to the people in charge of the course. They're always welcoming and friendly and they're really good points of contact. I'm Calsie Tyler and I studied Environmental Science with a year abroad. So I went to the University of Alberta in Edmonton in Canada and that was really interesting to see how they taught Environmental Science at that University in a completely different environment than Sheffield. I currently work as activity and engagement officer for Sheffield City Council Parks and Countryside Service."
Earth and Environmental Sciences - Quarry Field Trip,BiyFxhESkPM,ES,"Today we've checked out our first open-mine quarry so we'd been to Nenthead originally and checked out some kind of harder harder geology, but today was just going along and talking about the management of a quarry I went to a lot of different universities and read up on the course and the course content and stuff and it was very theorectical whereas Newcastle is really applied and the fact we're in the North-East means we've got accessibility to loads of different mines and that kind of thing so everything we learn in a module we then get taken out and shown how it applies to the real world and today is a great example of that we've been learning about the economic sustainability of extracting limestone, whether it be for construction or agriculture and then we've been taken to an open-cast mine and spoken to the manager Everything I do, it gets the context through the kind of industrial links that Newcastle's got so I'll be learning something and going: that's really interesting but I'm not sure how I'd ever get a job in that or make money through that but at the end of each module we then get taken out and shown how what we've just learned applies to the real-world So personally for me I find Earth Sciences at Newcastle really hands-on there's a lot of different field-trips we go on of all the ones I have previously been on I actually really enjoyed the one today for me personally mining and quarrying is very interesting to me since its such a large-scale operation it's really good to get an insight on how everything works, everything runs it's also useful to see as well for the environmental impacts the mining today actually did give me a great insight into an actual mining operation and maybe that is something I'd like to go into in the future I'm not a hundred percent sure what I want to do but I do think that these trips and going to places and speaking to people who have worked in the industry kind of gives me a direction and kind of gives me an idea about what I'd want to do myself"
Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies: Why Study in Philly?,asTbJBZ2QaI,ES,"Philadelphia is known as the City of Brotherly Love, so loving our planet would make sense starting in Philadelphia as well. We have the Schuylkill River, which has gone through multitudes of changes from pollution over the years, um, from the Industrial Revolution on forward. Um, now we have green trails and we have the Schuylkill Trail, which is a beautiful aspect. And then, right outside Philadelphia we have um, a lot of preserved land that are within 20 miles that are still in the Philadelphia area. Philadelphia is a great place to learn, uh, about, um, the environment and environmental change. Uh, we have a lot of resources around here just in the sheer number of universities, uh, around, um, the Philadelphia area. There's a lot of, um, innovative, uh, policies and work going on here in Philadelphia, especially related to the water industry in Philadelphia is very interesting to learn about. Um, pretty much anything that you can think about with, uh, environmental issues, you can focus on here in Philadelphia. Um, anything from, uh, environmental education - there's a lot of work in the schools out here - to looking at wetlands. Um, there's plenty of wetlands around the Philadelphia area that are pretty close to get to and you can get out and get some field work. So, the, um, University of Pennsylvania's just in a terrific location to work with a lot of great partners in the area. Right here in Philadelphia, we have the urban fields station, which is a US Forest Service branch, uh, right here in the city. We also have, um, the Region 3 office of the EPA right downtown and many of our students have gone and worked and done projects with those folks. Um, we have the Tookany/Tacony-Frankford Partnership, which is another community group that works with the Water Department to, um, work on watershed management right here in the city. We have the Stroud Water Research Center not too far away that students have worked with continuously on research projects. Um, we still have, uh, students working with the Academy of Natural Sciences and um, there's just so many opportunities here in the city where students can get involved with groups or organizations."
"Meet Ibrahim, environmental sciences student",pwN3QPJB4cY,ES,"Ibrahim Aburaneh: Hi, my name is Ibrahim Aburnaneh, and I'm a fifth-year environmental science co-op student. Today, I'm going to talk about why I chose my program. I chose my program because, if I'm being very honest, I'm very indecisive. I actually knew that I wanted to do environmental sciences, but I was afraid of commitment, especially at 17,18. It was a big choice to make. At Guelph, environmental sciences offers a first general year before you get to declare your major. The major options are environmental sciences, ecology, environmental economics and policy, and environmental resource management. And ask me then I had no idea what you were talking about, but ask me now, I'm very confident in my decision, and I'm very happy with where I ended up. And that was really because of that first year. I choose to stay involved at Guelph because, as a co-op student, sometimes it feels like you're missing out, especially when you're away on co-op, and that is not a feeling that I want to experience ever. So I made sure to make it a point to be involved as much as I can. I'm involved with the OAC at my college. I work on the OAC Instagram account. I'm involved with ESSE, the Environmental Science Student Executive, because those are my people. And I love discussing topics of environmental sciences. I'm very passionate about that. And finally, I'm a peer helper because if not giving back, then what are you doing in my opinion? And for those experiences and for that, I'm so thankful. I love this question. This is my favorite question. What advice I'd give to my first-year self? I'd tell myself to just relax. Honestly, I think I was really high strung. I was really nervous, even though everybody told me not to be. I was just up the wall asking a million questions all the time, which is totally fine. But I would say, ""You know what, take one big breath, and it's going to be okay. And make sure you plan your courses a little bit further ahead than you originally had because that will be a struggle later on."""

All about School of Resource and Environmental Management in 3 minutes!,HTpiQGyxD2U,ES,"The School of Resource and Environmental  Management at Simon Fraser University is  an interdisciplinary program that tries to  tackle a lot of the problems that we face today,  including things like heatwaves, climate change, ocean  acidification, food security in thoughtful, tangible ways.  I was motivated to choose the School of Resource  and Environmental Management because it's  one of the top interdisciplinary  environmental studies programs in all of Canada.  My research in the school that focuses on sustainable  transportation and climate change policy. The School of Resource and Environmental Management is a  remarkable place because it brings together highly motivated  students who are also very smart and you need  motivated and smart people to do the research    that we are doing in our department.  We study with a lot of faculty and students coming  from various different educational backgrounds  and also upon graduation.  This opens up a lot of various career paths.  The faculty members here are leading  scholars nationally and internationally.   They care very deeply about their work.  They care very deeply about their students.  The staff here are amazing. For me one of the great things about the  School of Resource Environmental Management  is that students can come here and work  with me looking at governance and policy,  but also learn from climate scientists and  ecologists about those processes as well.  My main area of research is a new  field called Food System Planning. It is a field of study and planning where   we integrate food system consideration  into city building and land use. For the everyday person it means,  “Where are your grocery stores located?  Do you get to have farmers market in your city?  Are you allowed to keep backyard chickens?”  My main area of research is avalanche risk  management or basically trying to better understand how    people make decisions when they go into the  backcountry and what kind of tools they could  use to make better informed decisions about when and where to expose themselves to avalanche hazards.   My students and I study coastal kelp forests and  how climate change is affecting those ecosystems.  We also study how predators, when they recover  to local ecosystems can cause a cascade of ripple  effects in those coastal ecosystems.  My big excitement and satisfaction about the School  of Resource and Environmental Management and  working here is its interdisciplinary nature and  the way in which we interact and learn from  each other and bring those different disciplines to bear in our own work. I think we're all in many ways bound by the mission of the place,  by the school to enhance the sustainability and  social justice of the world, and people are very  committed to that. They want to change  the world and it's a very exciting place to be. The School of Resource and Environmental Management  at Simon Fraser University is remarkable. Remarkable."
YorkU Student Stars - Faculty of Environmental Studies,KfYKf-Uc2ng,ES,"My name is Natalie Perigine. I am in my third year at York University. I am majoring in environmental studies and minoring in women's studies. My GPA at the end of second year was eight point seven five I'd say I was pretty much always an A student. I remember when I was little I would have kids call me up at home and they would ask me to help with their homework. I was always kind of teaching people around me. I came to York because they had very good scholarships. I really had a lot of personal relationships with animals when I was younger. We would go out into the forest and we would meet animals. I, as a kid I used to horseback ride. I don't anymore. But I would meet animals and learn their stories, and when I started realizing what happens to animals when they are used by humans, I realized that I wouldn't want that to happen to a person, so I wouldn't want that to happen to an animal either. I would probably call myself  a ""Vegan Crusader"", um maybe not anti-carnivor activist because that sounds a bit funny, probably because I do  spend a lot of time naturally talking about veganism. It's something that's very  very informed in my life and basically reaches all aspects of my life. As a vegan I want to achieve cultural change so that enough people know about it and are critically thinking, so they make choices that reflect what they actually believe in. And I try to achieve that at York. I started a vegan environmentalists group at York with my boyfriend and we currently run it. Right now I want to be a professor so I'm going to be taking my master's and then probably my PhD. I really enjoy the interaction between students and teachers. I really enjoy constantly being in a learning environment, but also being able to learn as well as a professor. I decided that this year, before I wanted to be an animal rights lawyer, but I realized that I didn't really want to be an animal rights lawyer, because I didn't really  understand. Because to me, I wanted to put forward legislation that would help animals, but I realized that legislation won't really do that. You need cultural change."
Study Environmental Science at Deakin University,2qPV62T4PLs,ES,"Environmental Science is a lot to explain, but for me it's how people work together within communities to work towards preserving the environment for better sustainable futures. I decided about five years ago, I did my first volunteering trip with Zoo's Victoria trapping eastern barred bandicoots, and I realised then that I always wanted to work with Wildlife Conservation Biology. I've always loved ocean life. Ever since I was young, I've always wanted to be a marine biologist. I chose to study at Deakin University because it's right on the open ocean where everything is. I just was really attracted to the course in terms of like, more field work and more hands-on experience. In Environmental Management and Sustainability, there is not one subject that doesn't have a practical aspect involved with it. From field work I've learnt how to I.D. animals, I've learnt how to handle small mammals. I've learnt how to work in a team. So whether it be being out the back of Deakin next to the creek doing water monitoring, out at the sewage plant learning about Melbourne's water systems, or up at the Grampians, learning about ecological niches of echidnas, Deakin offers such a wide range of practical experiences in this degree. You learn literally everything to do with the ocean, from invertebrates, mammals, like whales and dolphins. Within Environmental Management and Sustainability at Deakin they offer a really awesome subject called Global Placements and this gives us the opportunity to go all over the world to do conservation work and management work. I didn't realise that going overseas was an option. I went to South Africa and saw amazing animals, and in Peru I went to the Amazon and I was working with different native species there so that was pretty amazing. I would say if you want to study Marine Biology, do it. It's great, and there's so many interesting things to learn and you get to know the ocean and the things that live in it in so much depth, and it's really cool and really fascinating. Studying at Deakin has been a game changer for me. Throughout high school I really struggled with the pressure of VCE, but coming here has really shown me that I do have a true love of learning and every time I come here I get to demonstrate that again and again and again."
"U of M, Morris - Environmental Studies",p6oNnTG143g,ES,"The Environmental Studies program is a relatively new thing here on the Univeristy of Minnesota, Morris campus. A bunch of faculty got together across campus from all the different division really in response to ... I guess two reasons. One is, there was student demand. At UMM students are allowed to build their own major and we had quite a few students who had chosen to start an environmental studies major. But there are also a number of faculty in biology, geology, in economics, anthropology and english who were all interested in the environment and found that it was really stimulating for us to talk to each other and to think about devising a curriculum that we thought would better serve the students with a really intentional set of classes and electives. We got together we devised the curriculum. It took us several years to do that - thinking about the best way to do it. We brought it to the campus assembly and argued successfully that it should be a major and the regents passed that major four years ago. So we're in the third year, we just finished the third year of our major on the campus. It is very popular for a major that's only three years old, we currently have over 50 declared majors. And we just graduated, we had eight students graduate last year with the major."

Environmental Studies at Austin College,9Fwyr8ddjaM,ES,"So my name is Peter Schulze and my field is Ecology, or the study of ecosystems primarily,  and I've been at Austin College since the late 1990's.  Faculty from all over the college are involved in  the Environmental Studies program and  students who major or minor in Environmental Studies take courses from a wide range of faculty--  Some who are environmental specialists  and others who teach very closely related courses like Environmental Economics or Environmental Ethics.  Some do a lot of Field Biology,  some do more Political Science-type things,  and we even have people who combine Environmental Studies with  Art and all kinds of other fields.  I think one of the things that gets students most excited  right off the bat is our courses are not solely about science.  They definitely have heavy science content,  but our program is Environmental Studies. And so the courses also involve social science issues like Economics and issues from all across the campus,  such as ethics questions that are taught by Philosophers.   Once they get into upper-level courses,  then there's all kinds of opportunity to actually,  not just study the subject, but  do something.  So, for example,  students who take a course called Environmental Solutions propose ways to reduce the college's environmental impact.   And over the years, the college has adopted  more than 30 of these proposals that started  as students' projects. I think the hallmarks of the program are getting students actually involved  and actually doing something.  We've created opportunities that students have taken  to get their feet wet... but not always literally.  So sometimes it's in Field Biology,  but other times its finding ways to reduce  the green house gas emissions of the college. Or it may be through a summer internship.  We have exclusive arrangements with  three world-class organizations that work on different subjects  that have internships that are only available to Austin College students.  The Sneed Prairie Project is one of my favorite things  about our program.  It may sound strange to set fires for the sake of an ecosystem, but Austin College is in what's called a  Tall Grass Prairie Biome. The Prairie Biome was maintained by  two natural processes: Herds of bison trampling plants  and fires that burned plants.  The biome has almost completely been eliminated by urban development and agriculture, and so we're trying to restore a little bit of it.  And the fires actually happen to be one of the most powerful tools available. Our students tend to go into any of four areas once they graduate.  Some go to graduate school right away,  but others go to work right away.  And one of the surprises about Environmental Studies is  they're not out there wondering if they're ever going to find a job.  Our students don't tend to be struggling to find jobs. Some of them go to work for  companies as Environmental Specialists. Others work for non-profit organizations,  maybe in advocacy  or in some sort of Environmental Justice work, for example.  And others work for the government, whether it's  a federal government or a state government  or a city government.  You should consider studying the environment at Austin College  because we'll give you the opportunities to  start making a difference while you're here,  and the skills and abilities and experience that you need  to go make an even bigger difference after you graduate."
One on One: Victoria and Andrea Think Majoring in Environmental Sciences Opens Opportunities for You,uWnuBKiPqZ0,ES,"- [Both] Lab mates for life! - So why did you decide to major in environmental sciences? - For me coming into Duke, I knew I wanted to work with animals, and I knew I wanted to work in conservation, and my experience at Dr. Pimm's lab has just let me realize there's so many different fields and opportunities that are within conservation. We're working on hummingbirds in that part of the lab, but other people are working on mangroves, and then there's the big cats, and giant pandas, and just seeing that, in that one lab space, you're working on so many different issues, and I think the major really reflects that as well, the major is so open, and allows you to take different classes, and it just gives you the opportunity to explore different things and see what you want to do, so from that experience I've really narrowed it down, that I do know that I do want to work in the sciences, and I am pursuing the BS in the Environmental Sciences degree, and I would like to continue on after school and get an advanced degree and work on animal conservation. What's been your motivation for choosing the environmental science major? - So I guess I'm one of the lucky people who came to Duke knowing exactly what I wanted to do, which is basically I wanted to have a major that would allow me to pursue my passions of protecting the environment and learning everything I can about the natural world, and I found out that environmental science is so broad, it's so huge, it embodies (mumbles) law, and policy, and hard sciences, and all these things are interesting to me. So I've been exploring all of them, and by being in Dr. Pimm's lab, I've been able to explore the conservation research side of that, which has been incredibly interesting. So after I graduate from Duke, as an undergraduate, I'll hopefully be going on to graduate school. I have my sights set on a Ph.D in the future. I don't think I'll ever stop wanting to learn, and keep doing environmental work."

Environmental Studies at Fort Lewis College,8jk-F3_Yffw,ES,"The Environmental Studies Program is an interdisciplinary degree where students learn about environmental problem solving. This is not one department... they actually call it the program of Environmental Studies. and it's all-encompassing and you can just focus the emphasis of you studies on different majors, but also... it teaches you a lot about how you can impact. Positive impact. The Environmental Studies major gives you a template of which to form your own views on, how to form environmental change, as well as, it gives you knowledge about what is actually happening in our current day. In Environmental Studies we try to have as many hands-on opportunities for experiential learning as possible. Many of our classes take field trips to places like water treatment facilities or farms. To get the opportunity to go and spend the night down in Taos, New Mexico, and learn about the development of culture in that area and then you get to go stay in it for multiple days. I was not in an office doing coffee runs, I was actually outside with kids and... doing alternative environmental education We think it's really important for students to get an idea of.. what kind of career they want to go into... and how to get the skills while they are here in the department. They say that by the time you graduate, they will have found you a job. They will have prepared you for graduate school, which they have. Employers are looking for environmental scholars with interdisciplinary backgrounds and the skills that our students acquire through the program both with research methods and with GIS -- those skills are very desirable by employers in environmental fields. One thing that sets Environmental Studies students apart from other students is their passion for what they do and their passion for the environment. We are the rowdiest group in any class ... I think just at least my own experience -- most of my classes have been with the same 20 to 30 people for the last four years. And so we all  know each other really well we go skiing together, we go mountain biking together. As a skier and a climber, and a boater, being surrounded by people that have very similar aspirations and thought processes is really invigorating and most of my best friends are also in the major. I think that if you really enjoy the outdoors and you really enjoy seeing beautiful things, meeting awesome friends, and you have a deep passion for wilderness and public lands and the planet as a whole I think the Environmental Studies program at Fort Lewis is a fantastic call."
Anastasia Kaschenko - Bachelor of Environmental Science &amp; Studies,EFWdwcUV-iI,ES,"My name is Anastasia Kaschenko and I’m a fourth year student in the bachelor of Environmental Science and studies program. Trent’s program was one of the first Environmental science programs available I believe in Canada and North America, and so it’s renowned for that. But more importantly, I mean, education doesn’t just happen in the classroom. It happens with the people that you’re with, in the place that you are, you know, in the community that surrounds you. And that’s why I came to Trent, because it’s both a campus as well as the learning facilities inside the buildings that enable students to succeed in Environmental studies. Some of the things I have gotten to do at Trent with our amazing campus facilities; I have gotten to harvest vegetables. For the first time I pulled out a radish from the earth as part of my class and I’ve never even seen how vegetables grow and I’ve eaten them my whole life. We got to learn how to identify trees and use clinometers in our own forest on campus in the Drumlin. We have gone to the wetlands on our campus. We have an experimental farm on campus, we have rooftop gardens, we have a one-acre garden that’s open to all students. I mean, we can plant our own food and see it grow here. We have a roots cellar that students helped build. We do our own composting at Trent so students can see the full material cycle of eating a meal, composting it, knowing that it goes to a facility on our campus, and then having that compost be spread around to beautify our campus. That is integral to understanding these things in real life because they happen here and we are a part of them. If you're thinking about Trent, you are thinking the right thing."
"UNE 4+1 Tracks: Marine Science, Biological Science, Environmental Science or Environmental Studies",HagoCt0a7-o,ES,"The four-plus-one program is a graduate program  in marine science, biological science, environmental   science, and environmental studies. And what's  so special about it is that students work for   four years as an undergrad here at the  University of New England and only one   year after that they've done enough work to  get a master's degree in their chosen major.   My research is focused on tracking the tidal  exchange and surface currents between biddeford   pool and the larger Gulf of Maine. My goal  after UNE is to become a research vessel science   technician supporting large sea going projects.  My research is focusing on characterizing white   shark predation on gray seals in the New England  area. One of the reasons i actually chose UNE in   total was the four-plus-one program. I knew  I want to get a PhD after this so I thought   the four plus one program would be a really  good way to basically condense my bachelor's   and masters into the least amount of time and  money. So the ideal candidates for this program   are students who are very interested in  research and have done some of the research   during their undergraduate years. You also have  to have a 3.5gpa to get into the program. But then   once you're in the program you're going to finish  up all that research and graduate within one year.   My research is on the transgenic  American chestnut seedling and   whether or not it can successfully  sustain life in its native Maine region.   In most universities when you start with a  master's program from square one, you're kind of   running around trying to figure out where you're  going to fit in. Totally the opposite with the   four-plus-one program where you're developing a  research trajectory from the undergraduate level.   And that's one of the reasons why the quality of  the work that gets done at the four-plus-one level   is really high. Four-plus-one matched up perfect  with me. I've been doing ecological research   with Dr. Klack since 2019 and this program fit in  line with all my goals and ideals. One of the big   advantages of the four-plus-one program is that  you're working with people that you're already   familiar with you already know how everything  works at the University of New England. And so   you can just jump right into it instead of trying  to learn a new setup at a new school. You can get   a master's degree through the UNE four-plus-one  program in biological sciences, marine sciences,   environmental science and environmental studies so  you can be done at the age of 23 with a master's   degree, and be on and ready into your career much  faster than if you did a traditional masters."
Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies: After Graduation,Zu6ROVpEGy8,ES,"Our graduates, because of their unique and different backgrounds, they have essentially taken the MES as that changing lens. And as a result, they're then able to take different positions to support that. So they'll work in sustainable communications with consultancies. They'll work in, uh, sustainable analysts for, for consultants to essentially help companies essentially make that change. They've moved into government positions. They've taken roles within the UN. So there are a range of opportunities I think for our graduates to, uh, not just get a position, get a job, but also make a real contribution to how society then can evolve and move and be much more sustainable. I definitely, for my future career, I'm interested in sustainability. I believe that innovation technology in the future, so I want to do some kind of environmental consulting or environmental technology to solve some of the current environmental issues like resource management, water scarcity, like pollution and also, like, conflicts between human and wildlife. It's been very exciting for us also, um, to see, uh, the many different places our students go. So, they're coming in with varied backgrounds. We have six concentrations to choose from, and they're going out in many many different directions from, uh, nature centers as educational directors to, uh, corporate sustainability folks, uh, educational sustainability, um, uh, environmental biology, PhD programs, um, uh, EPA, NRDC, um, and then our students have also gone into, uh, more international places like, uh, UN Environmental Program, um, and even some of the, uh, Environmental Protection Agencies in other countries. So, students have gone on to a variety of really great positions, um, worldwide."
"Amy Fang Shi, PhD candidate in Environmental Sciences",vNWaWWS4sN4,ES,"All lifeforms have one essential purpose. Survival. But there is one plant that does not want to do that. You may wonder how is that possible, and why? This is plant is called American ginseng, and it is native to Canada. The Canadian expected value of ginseng is over 200 million dollars per year. Because of its high value and high demand in the Asian market, this crop has been grown commercially in the field since the late 19th century. However, soon after farmers start the cultivation, they realize although they can grow just about any crop after ginseng, if they plant ginseng again where it was first planted, the plant will suffer from a root rot issue and eventually die. Even after waiting 50 years, this devastating issue is known as ginseng replant disease. This poses a huge problem to our farmers because ginseng is picky in its environment, and it especially likes sunny soil. Well, I guess who doesn’t like lying down on a nice sunny beach? But replant disease means farmers always have to look for new land, and you guessed it. They are running out of land. So, the million-dollar question is why does ginseng die when replanted? This is the main question my research is focusing on. And the other question is, are we able to save ginseng? If people haven’t been able to after 100 years, is it because it is mission impossible? The only method that is currently available to our farmers is to use chemicals to kill soil pests before planting. However, when the diseases pests are high, this method doesn’t work. Plants are still going to die. Luckily, some new pest management strategies have been developed. Does it mean we have a new hope for controlling ginseng replant disease? I have been testing some of these new treatments in my research. Some of the treatments use the heat energy from the sun by covering the soil with a piece of clear plastic tarp to raise the soil temperature, roasting soil pathogens to death. This method provides good control of ginseng replant disease, but there is still more work to be done to verify the result. From my research, I am comparing three soil treatments to see whether if they are able to control ginseng replant disease, and to understand why these treatments may or may not work. By doing that, it can help us to understand the cause of the disease. My research aims the “vents” are understanding on ginseng replant disease, and bringing the hope of solving this issue. If we keep American ginseng, this Native plant of Canada grown healthy on our land then it will be a mission accomplished."

Environmental Sciences (Field Courses) | University of East Anglia (UEA),u0v6UUX5bEM,ES,"We take field courses  incredibly seriously, here in Environmental Sciences, because  we understand the values it brings by observing these processes in the field. So, that means that we have subsidised  field courses across the degree programme. The best part of the first year was  the Field Course, where we got to do loads of outdoor practical  work and I've got to meet loads of new friends. For me, the favourite part of my  degree was the field trip to Greece, where I studied active volcanoes and folds. Through this, I developed core  skills, which complemented theory learned in lectures. As part of my degree programme  was lucky enough to have spent a year studying in New Zealand to  the fantastic opportunity to go and studying a new culture in one of  the most beautiful parts of the world. We got to go to a rural village in  the North Kenya on a field course.

Environmental Sciences,i7AxAJjgCPc,ES,"It was really good to actually get the full picture. Because when you’re reading about it, you don’t like understand it completely, you know? It’s totally better when it’s hands on. What makes UNH unique in this regard really is the whole sustainability thrust on campus and activities in COLSA have a large part to play. You can take it and apply it to a real setting its not just in a textbook and it’s not just up on a blackboard. It’s definitely helped me grow as a researcher and in environmental science that’s important. It shows you there’s a lot of options open to you after you graduate. There’s options you weren’t even thinking about like managing a farm or something like that Working with John is great. It’s uh, he’s really knowledgeable. He knows a lot about the farming system, and just ecosystems and how they work, flows, energy balances, and nutrient balances. So we have to really give them the skills to be critical, to know the difference between a truth and a perception. And uh, so when they are out in the world facing real challenges they’ll have the right approach the right methods to solve those challenges and be of value to their employers, their communities wherever they find themselves. It opens up your eyes to other possibilities, for sure."
"Meet Kira, she studies Environmental Science at UQ",TyidzTeehjY,ES,"Hi I'm Kira and I study a Bachelor of Environmental Science at the University of Queensland. Environmental Science is looking at the world how it's elements interact with each other weather it is the earth, the plants, the soil, the water, the atmosphere, and you also get to learn about the issues that these things are facing. And also the amazing benefits that they can give to us. UQ ranks as one of the worlds top universities for environmental science. I chose UQ because I think it has such a beautiful campus, as well as really good links to research, so even if you're not interested in working in research your still being taught by people that are making the ground breaking discoveries in the field and have that really good knowledge to translate it to you. A lot of people know that the environment right now is facing a lot of problems, but also that it's really important for us to manage because its critical for our survival. Going into environmental science is really important because it allows you to understand the issues in depth but also how to communicate that to broader management context and the every day person that might not want to go into research but still wants to understand the kind of impact they can have."
Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies: Why Study in Philly?,asTbJBZ2QaI,ES,"Philadelphia is known as the City of Brotherly Love, so loving our planet would make sense starting in Philadelphia as well. We have the Schuylkill River, which has gone through multitudes of changes from pollution over the years, um, from the Industrial Revolution on forward. Um, now we have green trails and we have the Schuylkill Trail, which is a beautiful aspect. And then, right outside Philadelphia we have um, a lot of preserved land that are within 20 miles that are still in the Philadelphia area. Philadelphia is a great place to learn, uh, about, um, the environment and environmental change. Uh, we have a lot of resources around here just in the sheer number of universities, uh, around, um, the Philadelphia area. There's a lot of, um, innovative, uh, policies and work going on here in Philadelphia, especially related to the water industry in Philadelphia is very interesting to learn about. Um, pretty much anything that you can think about with, uh, environmental issues, you can focus on here in Philadelphia. Um, anything from, uh, environmental education - there's a lot of work in the schools out here - to looking at wetlands. Um, there's plenty of wetlands around the Philadelphia area that are pretty close to get to and you can get out and get some field work. So, the, um, University of Pennsylvania's just in a terrific location to work with a lot of great partners in the area. Right here in Philadelphia, we have the urban fields station, which is a US Forest Service branch, uh, right here in the city. We also have, um, the Region 3 office of the EPA right downtown and many of our students have gone and worked and done projects with those folks. Um, we have the Tookany/Tacony-Frankford Partnership, which is another community group that works with the Water Department to, um, work on watershed management right here in the city. We have the Stroud Water Research Center not too far away that students have worked with continuously on research projects. Um, we still have, uh, students working with the Academy of Natural Sciences and um, there's just so many opportunities here in the city where students can get involved with groups or organizations."

CERE graduate students at Duquesne University’s Environmental Science and Management Program,fEpYSfQ74O0,ES,"[Music] My name is Mackenzie Martin. I'm in the accelerated dual degree program for biology and environmental science and I'm in the Bayer School of Natural and Environmental Sciences. My name is Josh Steinbach. I'm a second year master's student in the environmental science and management program at Duquesne University. Having the dual degree program option at Duquesne in a couple of different scientific fields was really, really unique and that's part of the reason why I wanted to come to Duquesne. I started out in the forensic science and law program here and I realized that I had this passion for generally ""green sciences"" and being able to transfer out of one program and into another where I was still going to get two degrees in the same amount of time was really, really nice. I worked with a citizen's organization called Three Rivers Quest and Dr. Stoltz and just seeing like the good work that he has done at Duquesne helped me decide that I wanted to go to Duquesne and actually continue my education. So I work in the Kahler lab and we study water resource management and hydrology in the Limpopo Basin in South Africa. So I've been studying how to remotely sense river flow using satellite images in very small rivers. So this would allow researchers but also community managers to understand how much water is passing through their river at any given point in time that we have a satellite image for. (Josh Steinbach) A lot of the studies that I've been doing at Duquesne, especially regarding environmental laws, Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act have played a pretty big role. It gives me a better understanding of what we're actually trying to protect. I'm working on a documentary film that is depicting the research that I've been doing since I was an undergrad until now. So my thesis right now is based on that water resource management research. But the documentary has been something that has come out of my independent interests. I get to travel, I get to stand in rivers in a different continent, at a different country, and I get to experience this really cool thing. I wanted to share that with people who might not necessarily know what goes on in hydrology or in environmental science. (Josh Steinbach) I've worked with a couple of different professors trying to set up internships and teaching opportunities. They do a really good job of making sure that all your needs are looked after, whether it be you need to come in after class for extra help with a subject or just looking for an internship. They do a really good job of that. I actually got a really good internship with the EPA down in Cincinnati. We try to find a specific point where all the storm water will flow to and try to come up with some way to decontaminate the water. ( Mackenzie Martin) What mattered to me about Duquesne mostly was the values. Coming here made me feel like I would find people who would value me as a person. I've never experienced so much support from faculty members or mentors as I have here. The amount of people who have helped me achieve my goals and helped me become the person that I am today in this master's program and in my research, they've just helped me immensely. I didn't really expect, especially as a graduate student, to have such a connection to Duquesne like I did at undergrad, but it has definitely proved me wrong and I'm really glad that I came here.

How Nathan Got Into Penn to study Environmental Sciences and Business,VsWF_JOBkH0,ES,"(light music) - My name is Nathan and I just finished my Freshman year at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm studying environmental studies in the College of Arts and Sciences. I'm also doing a dual degree with the Modern School of business. I'd say my experience at Penn has been very fast pace and engaging. I've tried to involve myself in as many things as possible. On the term of expectations is definitely exceeded many of them. Two of them would just be the fact that so many students are so ambitious and that kind of rubs off on me. And the second one being the fact that there's so many things and so may opportunities to get involved in at school. It's really great, yeah. I wanted to study in the U.S. mainly because of the U.S. liberal arts system. That was one of the major factors influencing my choice. Aside from that I would say just wanting to get out of Melbourne and being able to experience more things, meet people from all around the world and experience new opportunities. I'd say Crimson helped me with two major things in the application process. The first one being exposing me to current students in potential colleges which I wanted to study at and just being able to gage like what that sort of person is and what these colleges are looking for and potentially what college I wanted to apply to. The second one being with the essays and being able to have someone to give me confidence and bounce ideas off and ensure that what I was writing wasn't just like really jargon and like really on the point. I would say that Crimson support was quite valuable in the sense that being able to speak to current students in the University gave me a lot more insight into what U Penn had to offer and also gave me a lot of confidence in the sense that I knew that U Penn was the school that I would want to attend and I wouldn't regret if I went there. In general just a lot of insight that I was not able to find on the web site. So I have two pieces of advise for incoming students. The first one being keep all the deadlines in your head and constantly have them on your wall, on your calendar, just because you don't want any bad surprises to creep up on you especially when you're so busy at high school in your last two years. The second piece of advise would just be getting into an ivy league you have to realize that it's not just about academics. Really just getting the fact that you need to practice on so many other things such as activities and who you are as a person."
BA in Environmental Studies at Pace University,ccAHuqOsg9E,ES,"(gentle pop music) - If you want to change the way the environment is going, Pace will give you the skills to make the difference. - The Environmental Studies program combines science, social science, philosophy, and it combines policy. The skills that they learn make students into both good analysts and good activists. - The faculty have really encouraged that feeling of passion, and you learn by doing. You get in the field, you feel connected, and you put it to work. Pace not only gave me the knowledge how to collect data, how to sample that data, but it also gave me the opportunity to take on these projects, to make up my own ideas, and to get into the field and to actually try it. That is helping me to relay that into getting into the career field. I love getting into the pond, getting my hands dirty. The work that I'm doing here is teaching me how algae works, how it works with a pond, and how a whole pond ecosystem comes together. So the skills that I'm learning allow me to take my knowledge of ecosystem stabilization and take it into other ecosystems. The ultimate goal is to make that difference to the environment and to ecosystems all over. We are going to save the environment. If you wanna make the difference, come to Pace. (upbeat pop music)"
Environmental studies | Wikipedia audio article,-dUIO6MgGEU,ES,"Environmental studies is a multidisciplinary academic field which systematically studies human interaction with the environment in the interests of solving complex problems. Environmental studies brings together the principles of the physical sciences, commerce/economics and social sciences so as to solve contemporary environmental problems. It is a broad field of study that includes the natural environment, the built environment, and the sets of relationships between them. The field encompasses study in basic principles of ecology and environmental science, as well as associated subjects such as ethics, geography, anthropology, policy, politics, urban planning, law, economics, philosophy, sociology and social justice, planning, pollution control and natural resource management. There are also many degree programs in Environmental Studies including the Master of Environmental Studies and the Bachelor of Environmental Studies. == History == The New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University established a BS in environmental studies degree in the 1950s, awarding its first degree in 1956. Middlebury College established the major there in 1965.The Environmental Studies Association of Canada (ESAC) was established in 1993 ""to further research and teaching activities in areas related to environmental studies in Canada"". ESAC's magazine, A\J: Alternatives Journal was first published by Robert A. Paehlke on 4 July 1971.The Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences (AESS) was founded in 2008 as the first professional association in the interdisciplinary field of environmental studies in the United States. In 2010, the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) agreed to advise and support the Association. The Association's scholarly journal, the Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences (JESS), commenced publication in March 2011.In the United States, many high school students are able to take environmental science as a college-level course. Over 500 colleges and universities in the United States offer environmental studies as a degree. == See also == == References == == External links == Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences Environmental Studies Association of Canada Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences"
The woman who revolutionized environmental education,1HDb9cuDkSA,ES,[Music] nature can be the best teacher when i was recovering from polio my father hired a botany professor to teach me and my siblings the professor preferred reading textbooks we preferred climbing trees when i opened my own school my method of teaching was the opposite of my professors my goal was to teach my students to love all living things in my classroom the students cared for animals they got their ends dirty in the soil climb trees and let their spirits run free it's important for children to understand nature so that when they grow up they will know how to protect it [Music] you
University Wisconsin - La Crosse Environmental Studies,EIq9AIZtpCA,ES,since joining the Environmental Studies Program my ideas on how to use my skills to improve the environment have changed more than I ever thought that they could I've taken all of my required credits and environmental studies and I honestly feel as if I have learned more in my minor that I have anywhere else in my journey through school I've learned about myself I've learned about the natural world around me and I've learned about the people and infrastructure that I live in and interact with every day I've developed more as a person intellectually spiritually and environmentally than ever before due to the people I've met the classes I've taken and the experiences that environmental studies has brought me the importance of individual actions is something I've contemplated a lot throughout this minor it wasn't until I took the environmental sustainability that this idea really got set in stone throat the course we covered an abundance of possible individual actions one can take and what type of impact you personally have on the environment reflecting on my experience here at UWL throughout the Environmental Studies minor program has been a very positive experience I'll ever forget the day I decided to make the switch minoring in something I had little interest in to something I've always been incredibly passionate about
Environmental Studies Graduate Programs,Ewfv-avBuEQ,ES,"[ Music ] >> My experience as a graduate student at Queen's has been incredible. I've worked collaboratively with a variety of professors on campus, I've been fortunate enough to travel for field work internationally, so those experiences have been incredible. >> It's been really a very positive experience. It's a very tight-knit community, very supportive, and a lot of broad research areas that bolster your own research. >> We have research going on in the hard sciences, social sciences and studies, chemistry, biology, toxicology. We have projects in the humanities. We're joint with geology and geography. It's limitless, and that's one of the true benefits and powers of this school. >> Queen's School of Environmental Studies really offers students an opportunity to engage with like-minded individuals that are fully committed to environmental sustainability. We really appreciate working in multifaceted teams for research that is both theoretically grounded and empirically evidenced. So, what we're really wanting to do is ensure that environmental issues are seen from a big-picture perspective, and that we train our students around professional development skills that helps us translate that knowledge into the public, private, and community realms. >> Our graduate students have a variety of career paths they can choose from. We range from industry to government and non-government organizations. We have students go on to med school. We have students go on to work for Natural Resources Canada. It's not just academics that our students work on. There's really endless amounts of opportunity, and one of the best things about our program is that students can really get out what they put into it, and we're always sure not to limit their dreams or goals after their graduate studies. >> Graduate courses in this program are designed to challenge the way that you would normally think, so coming from my background, I had to really challenge my way of thinking, and fostering really critical thinking was really important in my education. >> I think one of the things that I value most about our school is the collaborative nature, and the open-door policy between students and professors. I've learnt so much through both formal and informal dialogue with professors in this school. [ Music ]"

Importance of Environment in Day to Day Life in English,FikvfgoA04s,ES,"Environment is everything that is around it can be living or non-living things that include physical-chemical and other natural forces living things live in their environment. They constantly interact with is and changing response to conditions in their environment. Importance of Environment Environment plays an important role in the healthy living of human beings. It matters because it is the only home that humans have, and it provides air, food, and other needs. Humanity's entire life support system depends on the well-being of all the environmental factors. Environment plays an important role in regulating air and climate. Another reason the environment is so important is that it is a source of natural beauty, and it is necessary for proper physical and mental too. Environment is the key existence of life on the earth. Environment is the only sole factor for the existence of life on this earth. Our environment provides us everything to live a better life and starts from clothes, food, light, air, and furniture to beautiful landscapes, waterfalls, and forests. The ecosystem helps us with agriculture and grow crops and vegetables. Our waste products were absorbed and decomposed as compost for agriculture. Humans were served by the environment in several ways and are still using nature for various personal uses. The environment is an important part of our life, without which the living things couldn’t survive on Earth. The only planet in our solar system that supports for the existence of life is it earth due to the presence of the environment."
App State Geological and Environmental Sciences Triassic trip,-U1TN_9j-oc,ES,"The key takeaways that I hope students would  get from this trip are that they get to see   that paleontology is much more than just  wandering around the desert finding fossils.   They get a chance to find out that maybe they're  actually good at something that they didn't   think was maybe in their DNA. But really what I  want them to get a chance to see is just the very   many different ways that paleontology is done.  The many different people who do paleontology,   not just professionals, but volunteers  from all walks of life. I try to make   sure that basically everybody has a couple of  weeks of solid experience under their belt.   This has proven invaluable when  students go to get internships,   because I can write a letter recommendation that  highlights the experiences they've had with me.   That's good. All of that is a big part of the trip  and there's also just a lot of maturity, bonding,   peer leadership, peer teaching and a lot of  things that go with the trip and the course   that they might not explicitly expect, but  which take away any way you look at it. The important part of this trip is these are  paleontology students who haven't really gone   out that much in the field except for the  occasional field trip and this is their   first ""for real"" field experience, where they  have to go and live outdoors and eat outdoors   and keep a good attitude and with the bonus of  looking for fossils and hopefully finding them. So   the supporting role is helping them learn to be  comfortable and living and working outside which   honestly not many of them have had that experience"

Studying MSc Environment and Sustainability - Dr Aideen Foley,w76EHDHQR5Q,ES,"Good evening. My name is Aideen Foley and  I'm a lecturer in environmental geography   and I'm teaching the module Environment and  Policy. It's a core module for students on the   MSc in Environment and Sustainability, and  this module is all about introducing different   ways of addressing environmental challenges through policy.  So, thinking about legislative   approaches, market-based approaches, and also about  civic environmentalism. Students who take these   programs sometimes go on to roles in environmental  consultancies or in local and national government.   So, it's really important that they have a sense of  what approaches are being used by decision-makers,   to address environmental challenges. So, at Birkbeck  we teach for three-hour slots in the evening,   and we're always thinking about ways of breaking  that time off and making things interesting. So for   today's session on environmental injustice we're  using a technique called story cubes, to generate   conversations about the topic. My name is Giles Lane. I am an artist and designer, and I direct   a non-profit arts organization called Proboscis.  And I'm connected to Birkbeck in a number of ways,   have run a number of collaborative research  projects with Birckbek over the years. Story cubes are a very simple concept it's a paper  cue that we invite participants in workshops to   write or draw ideas on and then to come  together, to collectively build a narrative   structure to explore the ideas of how they  connect, how they disrupt one another, how   the complexity of the world can be  reflected in the uneven way, in which   ideas, issues and concerns about shared or common  problems, can be represented. Tonight what we were   doing was using this applying this technique to the topic of environmental injustices, and so   students firstly brainstormed together a kind  of long list of their thoughts about what drives   environmental injustice or what kind of conditions  might contribute to that. And then they were   invited to prioritize the top six concerns as they  felt it as individuals by representing them on   each side of the cube. And then they came together  again as a group to put those cubes together,   and create a structural representation of their  ideas and the connections between them. And of   course, in putting things together, some ideas might  get closed off or obscured and then that triggers   conversations about what those ideas are, and what  ideas are being promoted or brought to the fore.   So it was a really interesting way of catalyzing  those discussions, and giving form to complex ideas,   which are somewhat intangible,  without having the prop of story cube.

Studying the Environment at CBF&#39;s Macon and Joan Brock Classroom,NRjr2r4xTpA,ES,"We all heard of this program through  different ways and we're from different   schools but our passions and this  place have brought us together. The   future is unwritten but through this  program we have a hand in writing it.   Because of your support, because of these  connections, you are turning dreams into reality. The Environmental Studies Program has completely  altered my life over the past two years. Growing   up I never imagined the environment as more than  what was right in front of me. Being a part of   the program has completely opened my eyes to the  world of environmental science and protecting it. Through the Environmental Studies Program, I  worked through an internship with Convert Solar,   I convert, I had hands-on experiences with  electricians, residential install teams,   and the warehouse crew. This program  provided me a number of experiences   that I know I would not have had  the opportunity to have otherwise. Like many kids, when I was younger, I  really wanted to become a marine biologist.   But this kid got the opportunity to become  an inaugural member of the Brock Center's   Environmental Studies Program. With that, in  my senior year, I got internship opportunities   with the Virginia Aquarium that only  fostered my love for marine biology. This program has allowed me to cultivate  my knowledge and discover my passion for   developing sustainable solutions for equity-based  issues. Through my published research paper with   APA in my advocacy internship with the Chesapeake  Bay Foundation, Ive discovered the importance and   need for environmental literacy, which I actually  advocated for at the Virginia General Assembly. I wanted to connect with environmental leaders  like the Norfolk Botanical Gardens and the   Chesapeake Bay Foundation and empower communities  around me. I was also able to intern at Dills Architects to learn about how architecture can  help fight food insecurity in Hampton Roads. Hi, my name is Savannah Jacks and my  next step before changing the world   will be attending the University of Mary  Washington to study environmental science. Because of this, I've asked Convert (Solar) to  take me on as apprentice so I can further   my technical education and become  a master electrician in my future. After my life in this program, I'm  headed off to BCU for the next four   years. I'm going to study environmental science. I'll be continuing my studies at  Virginia Tech next year while majoring   in environmental policy and planning with  a minor in leadership and social change. My name is Caitlin Whitfield and I  will be continuing my study of earth   science at James Madison University.  Thank you for supporting our class. Thank you for this building the Brock Classroom,   which helps us fulfill our hopes and dreams.  Mine is to become an environmental engineer."
Department of Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences at Michigan State University Introduction,iTtJb2SAq7U,ES,"- Hi, I'm Dr. Jeff Freymueller. Welcome to the Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences website. We're glad you're here. What makes geosciences really unique is actually its interdisciplinary nature. So we take students from chemistry, from physics, from biology, from computer programming, all sorts of different fields working with big data, working in the field, working in labs. So we do everything, apply every method you could imagine to study the Earth and the environment. Degrees in the sciences have a high value. The training you get from a degree in the sciences or mathematics lets you go anywhere. You could go to a career in academia. You could go into a career in research, a career in industry. You could go to a career in finance. The skills that you learn in a degree in the sciences will make you very employable. And in our department, because we also offer the opportunities of research and, you know, you're not just one of 500 students in a classroom, the opportunity for more personalized instruction gives you the opportunity, if you choose to take advantage of it, to build those skills even further and give yourself real job experience and real world experience working with real data and real information. That's where the knowledge economy is building new jobs. That's where you should go. One reason that our alumni are so employable is that the resources we use in our society ultimately derive from the Earth. Whether you're talking about food or metals or energy, minerals, it all comes from the Earth one way or the other and it's tied together with Earth and environment. And so the skills that you learn in our department open all these different kinds of doors for you and allow our students to go into a wide range of professional careers. If you have questions, reach out and contact us. The information's on the website. We're glad to hear from you and we hope to see you on campus soon. (upbeat music)"
Introducing Climate Studies: an interdisciplinary approach to a groundbreaking new major,qM2YjdqyQ5M,ES,it's no longer just mitigating or addressing climate change so that we reduce greenhouse gas emissions but it's also adapting to the changes around us this major really brings together the humanities social sciences and natural sciences our organizations are very complex our problems are complex and we need people who can talk across fields and disciplines and work together in teams [Music] we have a very dense and vibrant interdisciplinary conversation going on across the schools and across the departments we work together to create a curriculum that would balance these different sides and give students the opportunity to learn about climate change and climate solutions from multiple disciplinary perspectives climate change isn't just about science and engineering it's about how the science the engineering then come down to affecting society we need the sociologists we need the economists we need the political scientists and then at the end we need to talk about what does this mean in our lives working through the humanities it lets us look at the the sort of all of the experiences of humankind and all of the strategies people have come up with through time to survive climatic changes this can give us hope going forward that we're going to keep inventing and thinking strategically and creatively about new ways of interacting with our environment if you are a student who's interested in investing a lot of their civic and professional effort in helping solve major social and environmental problems if you want to collaborate with others to really make a difference and advance some meaningful solutions this is really a great major for you so from the moment that they declare this major the students are going to be learning from professors who run the gamut in their interests in the environment but they're also going to be discussing all of these issues with each other and i think right from the beginning what's so important about this is that we're breaking down those barriers and putting all the students together to learn from each other from the start so the generation that's in college now the generation that's just getting ready to enter college they want to know what they can do they want the knowledge that's going to help them take charge of what they're going to do about climate change politically technologically in the business world in the moral and ethical world working in diverse teams is something that is very important for climate change but it's important for lots of other things in people's lives and their careers and we're going to prepare students to do that we're going to allow students to understand different disciplinary perspectives on climate change and climate solutions that will we think really be an important foundation for them as they move forward into careers in this area
What are studies in environmental humanities? | ASU Online,rAb5jctWtLg,ES,"(uplifting music) - I'm excited to teach this course because the environmental humanities is something that pertains to everyone. Whether you're a scientist or a historian or filmmaker, it's a way of connecting people who come from different perspectives. - We'll be looking at artists and writers, and we'll be looking at the ways in which writers have literally changed the way humans think about their relationship to the planet. - I think students should be excited about this class because there is such a rich, visual and written culture around our environments, and what that means is they get a chance to engage, not just with these intellectual ideas, but also with their creative side, and look at ways in which media and literature have helped people to inspire hope and care and excitement around our natural environments. - It's really important to understand your own relationship to place and planet. So we'll be thinking about concepts like sense of place. How do humans understand their relationship to place? Where does our water come from? Where does our garbage go? Most people don't actually think about those issues. We'll be thinking about those issues, but also using our growing understanding of sense of place to chart for ourselves a different path towards this as a sustainable future. - The skills that you learn here are definitely transferable to your professional life, regardless of where you decide to go. - Students can expect to go away from this course having engaged in reading and writing, and also more creative presentations in which they're expressing their own ideas about how we will chart that more sustainable direction towards the future."
Noah Brennan &#39;20 - Environmental Studies,L62-bBX0CwI,ES,"- When I visited Pace, I loved the facilities there, I met some great professors, and I was taken away right then and there. The environmental program's facilities here, specifically on the Pleasantville campus, were, and are, incredible. The environmental faculty here at Pace are extremely knowledgeable even if you had one class in the environmental field you can always go back to that professor and ask for advice whether it's for the class or maybe it's for something completely different that you're just struggling with, and they're all just absolutely wonderful when it comes to being a resource for students, during their time here at Pace as students and then after they graduate. As the Green Pace intern my focus has been on student involvement in sustainable practices. One of my lead jobs is helping the compost system here at Pace for our food, our dining services. Pace is clearly moving forward to a greener, more sustainable future. (upbeat music)"

Christopher Nolet -  Environmental Sciences,wTtIsqXH_I4,ES,So my name is Christopher Nolet and I'm a fourth-year student right now and I'm actually originally from Quebec and when I was looking at the university programs I came to Guelph on one of the university tours and I found it was really interesting because when I did my prior to degree which was in in college actually in Montreal it was mostly just sciences and I really like the policy and the economic basis it was basically trying to use Sciences and Economics and merging it all together it is really fun to see how all the disciplines come together and I found this really a good opportunity right now in the marketplace so out so I ended up choosing Guelph. I  actually came to visit six times before ending up here so I just really wanted to make sure it was the University I wanted and the food here really swayed me as well as the townhouses which it was really really nice compared to all the other Universities. As for academics it's really interesting on my first trip to Guelph I met a couple of my professors and spoke to them at the the biology building and crop science building as well and they talked a lot about their current research right now And it was really really quite interesting how they're using economics and trying to value non-market goods so basically like water quality marshes for the sequestration of carbon dioxide phytoremediation and all sorts of other ecosystem services so since I came from Quebec I had to apply as a transfer student and it's not exactly all that easy because your credits aren't 100% transferable they kind of have to look at them and then figure out what how they would transfer over to university credits at Guelph and I actually ended up getting a lot of really strange and bizarre credit transfers like I had a bunch of architecture courses that were transferred to religion courses here so even if you have three years of a college degree you can only get up to a maximum of one year worth of credits but even then you might not get a full year's worth the credits because some of those classes just won't be able to transfer over so that's one thing to keep in mind. I am involved in the French club because I'm from Quebec I just thought it would be interesting to join the French club and I join there in first year and I was basically the finance coordinator that was there and I basically run their budget and figure out how much they can spend on each evert and keep track of that and then in the second year I became the president of the club that is pretty interesting as I worked on organizing also some events and it was with one of my friends that was a master student at the time in the French program and she started out and a genetrics program here to so even in the French club there's people from all sorts of different backgrounds there's actually quite a few science students and barely any bachelor of arts so there's a nice mix there so even in those tailored clubs you give meet a lot of different people so that's one of the great parts of the University of Guelph is that it's kind of a small campus and there's just people all over the place in different backgrounds you can learn a lot so it's nice to share like that
Environmental Health Sciences,1PXKj1J0YBc,ES,"[MUSIC PLAYING] Our department has really developed a niche for doing research on understanding whether our environment is healthy and whether the environment is contributing to diseases that people really care about. My lab is focused on understanding how diseases like breast cancer might be starting because of chemicals that we're exposed to in the womb. Air pollution kills somewhere around between 6 and 7 million people per year across the planet, and this is a profound public health hazard. We're quite worried about how this interacts with humans and human development. The vast majority of our effort is based on instrument development, working in the developing world, building cohorts and capacity for measuring air pollution, and trying to identify the causes of what parts of air pollution are most toxic for you and I. We're a developmental toxicology lab. We use the zebra fish model to study how exposure to environmental pollutants can predispose embryos to metabolic dysfunction, diabetes, obesity later on in life. What my lab is really focusing on is looking at how these environmental factors influence these epigenetic marks in sperm. We're using endocrine disrupters-- a class of compounds known to affect hormone levels. We're one of the first studies to look at both paternal and maternal exposures to these compounds. We're doing cutting-edge research that is interdisciplinary. We're spanning integral chemistry to biochemistry, environmental toxicology, and even some environmental epidemiology. So being able to get trained in a very broad range of disciplines really will make for a well-rounded experience that I'd be hesitant to believe you get anywhere else. We're an innovative group in that we try our hardest to come up with new methods and new science that has never existed before. This department will drive modern science forward. We're doing research that's really having an impact, not just in the world of science but in the world of public health and public good. [MUSIC PLAYING]"
Barbara Turpin welcomes you to the Dept. of Environmental Sciences &amp; Engineering,COIAFwOfvPA,ES,"Hi,I'm Barbara Turpin. I'm the Chair of the Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering and my expertise is in air pollution, atmospheric chemistry and aerosol science. I can tell you all about COVID transmission by aerosols. My group has been studying wildfire emissions and the atmospheric transformations that happen to those emissions. and affect people's exposures. Finally, I've been studying the chemistry in homes and that has a big impact on people's exposures to chemicals, since we spend so much time indoors. Well, one thing I've been trying to do during the pandemic is to take my coffee and walk down to the creek and have my coffee down there most days. I'm really looking forward to seeing you when you are in person here in Chapel hill. Thanks. See you soon."
Ken Gillingham on the Environment and Economics,nFzhbUsx6EQ,ES,"I do research on environmental economics. I examine how policies can be better designed to be more effective and cost effective to reduce emissions and improve livelihoods. I've been very passionate about this issue going back to when I was a young child and I would go for hikes in mountains with my parents. I grew up just north of New York City, about an hour and a half from here. I worked for the Forest Service. I was a Wilderness Ranger in both the White Mountains as well as in Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming. I'm passionate about improving the environment, but I'm also passionate about doing it in a way that, retains people's livelihoods. I want students to understand the ethical considerations of policy. Distributional consequences ... By ""distributional consequences"", what I mean is who's helped and who's harmed by policies? Those are critically important. I worked at the White House for the Council of Economic Advisers as the senior economist for energy and the environment and I worked deeply on a whole slew of regulations that are now being repealed or pulled back in some way. Now climate policy has been shifting back to the States. Connecticut is doing a huge amount. California is doing a huge amount. Other countries around the world are doing a huge amount. As long as we keep at it and keep working hard to develop, from my perspective, good research and also teaching some of the next leaders of the world which are right here at Yale. I'm very optimistic that it is a long game and that in time we will actually be making a difference."
College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences,vy9ijzzAtk8,ES,"all right everyone this is gonna be a lot of fun  this is one of the very few times the college tour   gets to visit a horse barn this one in  fact has been here for over a hundred years   and that's where we're gonna meet  Gabby she's a freshman majoring   in animal science and she's gonna talk  about her experience as a city girl   in the college of agricultural and  environmental sciences okay Gabby you are on hi everyone so growing up i always knew that  i wanted to work with animals i had two cats   Casey and Ratzky and my favorite book growing  up was my encyclopedia of dog breed so during   high school i had the opportunity to shadow one  of my local veterinarians for a couple months   and i knew right away that that was what i wanted  to do so right now my dream is to attend the UC   Davis school of veterinary medicine which by  the way is the number one ranked vet school in   the world and i want to work with large predators  and rehabilitative zoos but as of right now i am a   first-year animal science major in the college  of agricultural and environmental sciences we   offer 28 majors and 40 minors in a broad variety  of topics that have everything to do with the   sustainability and safety of our planet we have  stuff covering climate change conserving habitats   making sure people have the food space and hope  that they need it also includes a science of   brewing and wine making and of course the health  of our lovely animals like i said it covers a lot   choosing Davis was one of the best decisions  i have ever made even despite the pandemic   our professors have gone above and beyond to make  sure that our classes are engaging and that we're   learning the material that they're teaching i knew  i was at home when i started my first class ""Intro   to Animal Science"" with Professor Russ Hubby for  a class project we even conducted an experiment to   see whether we could teach his old dog a new trick  and so we took his dog Sonny and we tried to see   if we could teach her to jump through a hoop and  she did it and it was the cutest thing ever if i'm   being completely honest it was a bit of a culture  shock moving from the Bay Area to Davis because   i'm surrounded by farm animals but i fell in love  so fast there are so many different ways for our   students to get their hands dirty and get into  some research and internship opportunities here on   campus we have internships and hands-on learning  opportunities ranging from a student-run student   farm to landscape architecture and our vertical  gardens one of the ones that i'm actually really   interested in is one that's right here at our  horse barn where students get to work with our   mares, foal, and stallions because fun fact we  are also a fully functional breeding facility   here in addition to being a teaching barn it  has been truly a pleasure to spend my first year   here at UC Davis and i cannot be more excited  to see what my future holds back to you Alex Gabby thank you for sharing what sounds like a  memorable first year that gives new meaning to   hands-on learning and you want to work with  large predators at the zoo i can't wait to   see that happen good luck on your journey to  veterinary school and beyond thanks again Gabby"
